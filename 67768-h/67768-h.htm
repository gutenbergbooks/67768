<p>The preparation of this hand-book was suggested
by persistent questioning about the matters it contains.
Its purpose is to furnish householders with
information which has been so scattered, or buried
so deep in technical discussions, that it has not been
easy for them to find it for themselves. It is, of
course, mainly a compilation, and the only difficulties
met with have been those incident to the arrangement
and condensation of a large mass of
material. I have intended to give credit, where
credit seemed to be due, for everything borrowed,
and, if I have failed to do so in any case, it is not
my fault, but my misfortune.</p>

<small>AIR.</small></h2></div>


<p>Normal air contains 79 per cent of nitrogen,
20.96 per cent of oxygen, and .04 per cent (4 parts
in 10,000) of carbonic acid.</p>

<p>Oxygen supports animal life; carbonic acid,
vegetable life; and the use of the nitrogen, otherwise
than as a diluent, is not known.</p>

<p>Very pure air contains 78.98 per cent of nitrogen,
20.99 per cent of oxygen, and .03 per cent of carbonic
acid.</p>

<p>Air begins to be very bad when the oxygen is
reduced to 20.60 parts in 100. In mines, where candles<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>
go out, oxygen is reduced to 18.50 parts in 100,
and, in the worst specimen yet examined by Angus
Smith, to 18.27. Air in which the percentage of
oxygen has been reduced to 17.20 is very difficult to
remain in for many minutes.</p>

<p>Aside from impurities due to local causes, the
purest air is found from six to forty feet above
the ground, and the most impure from seventy to
ninety feet, where the air from chimneys is poured
forth.</p>


<p><b>Air is contaminated by the products of
respiration and the bodily emanations of
healthy persons, and by the products of combustion.</b></p>

<p>An adult man, in ordinary work, gives off in
twenty-four hours from twelve to eighteen cubic
feet of carbonic acid, according to his size; women,
children, and old persons less.</p>

<p>Edward Smith found that an adult asleep exhaled
about nineteen grains of carbonic acid per
hour, and, when he walked three miles an hour, the
amount was increased to 100.6 grains.</p>

<p>W. R. Nichols, of Boston, found in passenger-cars
23.2 parts of carbonic acid to 10,000 parts of
air, and in the Berkeley Street sewer 10.4 parts per
10,000. Wilson found in Portsmouth Prison, in cells
containing six hundred and fourteen cubic feet of
air, always occupied, 7.20 parts per 10,000, and in
cells containing two hundred and ten cubic feet, occupied
only at night, 10.44 per 10,000.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span></p>

<p>Besides the carbonic acid, there is exhaled from
the lungs a small amount of organic matter, of unknown
composition. It forms a glutinous coating
on the furniture, walls, and windows of closed rooms,
decomposes rapidly, imparts a peculiarly offensive
odor to the air of a badly-ventilated room, and poisons
those who inhale it. Its quantity is so small
that it has so far defied analysis. In a room contaminated
by respiration alone, the odor of this substance
begins to be perceived when the carbonic acid
has increased to about 7 parts in 10,000, and 10 parts
in 10,000 may be considered the maximum amount
of carbonic acid allowable in dwellings.</p>

<p>The following table shows how much carbonic
acid artificial lights produce per hour:</p>

<p>A five-foot gas-burner produces as much carbonic
acid per hour as five men.</p>

<p>As the most poisonous element of the breath can
not readily be detected by analysis, the amount of
carbonic acid is taken as a measure of the impurity
of air contaminated by respiration.</p>


<p><b>Test for carbonic acid in air</b> (Pettenkofer’s
method):</p>

<p>Shake up a definite volume of the air in a closed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>
vessel with a definite amount of lime-water. The
carbonic acid unites with the lime, forming carbonate
of lime. This compound, being insoluble in
water, renders it turbid. The degree of turbidity
may be judged of by looking through the water at
a cross marked in lead-pencil on the inside of a
piece of paper pasted on the opposite side of the
bottle, and a standard may be fixed by shaking up
ordinary external air in a sixteen-ounce bottle, as
described below, which will show the degree of turbidity
produced by 4 parts of carbonic acid in 10,000.
Lime-water can be bought of a druggist, or made by
shaking distilled water with slaked lime, allowing it
to settle, and pouring off the clear liquid. With a
common hand-ball syringe, the end of the rubber
tube resting on the bottom of the bottle, pump in air,
until the bottle is filled with the air to be tested.
Put in half an ounce of lime-water, cork the bottle,
and shake it up well. Let it stand for five minutes,
and if the water becomes turbid, as if a little milk
had been dropped into it, the presence of carbonic
acid in the air will be indicated in the following proportions.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Dangers of such Contamination.</i></p>

<p>Air contaminated by the products of respiration
and by bodily emanations (perspiration, etc.) contains
substances which have been ejected from human
bodies as useless or injurious. What all systems
reject can not be healthy for any, and it is
found that long-continued exposure in an atmosphere
laden with these impurities produces anæmia,
general debility, and poor nutrition, conditions likely
to result in the development of scrofula and consumption.
It is believed, too, that typhus fever may
originate in this manner, while when such poisons
are inhaled in a more concentrated form, as in the
famous Black Hole of Calcutta, nausea, vertigo,
convulsions, and even death are produced.</p>

<p><b>The air is at certain times and places contaminated
by the products of respiration and
the bodily emanations of diseased persons.</b></p>

<p>In certain diseases, commonly known as <b>contagious</b>,
organic matters are thrown off by the
lungs and skin of the sick, which tend to reproduce
these diseases in the bodies of other persons. The
exact nature of these poisons is in most cases unknown,
but they are generally believed to be living
microscopic organisms (bacteria, bacilli, micrococci,
etc.), which multiply their kind in the blood of the
person who has inhaled them.</p>

<p>Of such diseases, the dangerous ones are small-pox,
measles, scarlet fever, typhus fever, and diph<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>theria,
and their contagious quality is marked very
nearly in the order in which they are here mentioned.</p>

<p>The less harmful of these diseases are whooping-cough,
chicken-pox, mumps, and German measles.</p>

<p>There is strong evidence that consumption is
contagious, though not as markedly so as the diseases
above enumerated.</p>


<p><b>The air may be contaminated by the products
of the decomposition of the excreta of
healthy persons.</b></p>

<p>The contents of cesspools, privy-vaults, and sewers,
are generally composed of discharges from the
bowels and kidneys, various matters washed off from
the bodies of animals and from culinary and household
utensils, and dissolved soap, constituting a mixture
which rapidly decomposes and affords a fine soil
for the nourishment and propagation of microscopic
organisms.</p>

<p>Air contaminated in this way, popularly known
as <b>sewer-gas</b>, contains sulphide of ammonium and
sulphureted hydrogen (which cause the characteristic
odor of rotten eggs), carbureted hydrogen, nitrogen,
and carbonic acid (odorless), and certain undetermined
organic matters.</p>

<p>Professor Nichols analyzed the air of the Berkeley
Street sewer in Boston, a type of a badly-constructed
and badly-ventilated sewer. The sulphureted
hydrogen, etc., were in too small quantity to
be measured. The highest percentages found were,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>
of oxygen, 20.90; of nitrogen, 79.26; of carbonic
acid, .4 (40 parts in 10,000). The lowest were,
oxygen, 20.48; nitrogen, 78.89; and carbonic acid,
.05 (5 parts in 10,000).</p>

<p>Letheby found that sewer-water (containing 128.8
grains of organic matter to the gallon) excluded from
air yielded, for nine weeks, 1.2 cubic inches of gas
per hour. In one hundred volumes of this mixture
there were 78.83 parts of marsh-gas (carbureted hydrogen),
15.90 parts of carbonic acid, 10.19 parts of
nitrogen, and .08 of sulphureted hydrogen. Examination
of sewage-mud in the Seine by Durand-Claye
gave 72.88 parts of marsh-gas, 13.30 of carbonic acid,
6.70 of sulphureted hydrogen, 2.54 of carbonic oxide,
4.58 of nitrogen, and some other gases. Such mixtures
are sometimes found in long-closed cesspools and
privy-vaults, but not in sewers proper.</p>

<p>Of these gases, sulphureted hydrogen and carbonic
acid are very poisonous, and when they are inhaled
in concentrated form produce almost immediate
unconsciousness, and often death. When less
concentrated, sewer-air may cause nausea and vomiting,
followed by a low fever which sometimes kills,
and, if not, results in a tedious convalescence. As
a rule, it is so largely diluted that it produces no
immediate effects, excepting the discomfort due to
offensive odor, and the mental anxiety resulting
therefrom.</p>

<p>The effects usually attributed to the continued
breathing of diluted sewer-air are general <i>malaise</i>,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>
loss of appetite, anæmia, impaired nutrition, and
therefore diminished power of resistance to attacks
of disease which are not directly attributable to
sewer-air poisoning. It is doubtful whether these
effects are due to the constant introduction of sewer-air
in minute quantities into the blood, or to the
inhalation of particles of organic matter floating in
such a contaminated atmosphere.</p>

<p><b>The greatest danger, however, in the
breathing of sewer-air is that of inhaling
with it the living particles</b> (bacilli, etc.) <b>contained
or developed in the excreta of diseased
persons</b>.</p>

<p>The diseases believed to be propagated in this
way are <b>cholera</b>, <b>typhoid fever</b>, and <b>dysentery</b>.
The discharges both from the mouth (stomach) and
bowels are known to be poisonous.</p>

<p>It is believed by many that the poisons of typhoid
fever and diphtheria may be developed <i>de novo</i> by
the decomposition of the mixtures found in cesspools
and sewers.</p>

<p>There also seems to be a connection, imperfectly
understood, between bad drainage and malarial fevers,
and perhaps cerebro-spinal meningitis.</p>

<p>The origin of yellow fever is not yet ascertained.</p>

<p>Surgical erysipelas, puerperal fever, and hospital
gangrene, are only developed on and about wounded
surfaces, and seem to be due to the organisms developed
in the secretions of such surfaces, where
ventilation and drainage are bad.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span></p>


<p><b>Air may be contaminated by the products
of organic decomposition rising from the
ground and drawn into the house through
furnace-flues</b>, etc.</p>

<p><b>Ground-air</b> contains from 1.49 to 80 parts per
1,000 of carbonic acid, and frequently contains products
of organic decomposition. A damp soil is also
very unhealthy, as shown by Bowditch and others.
“A persistently low ground-water, say fifteen feet
down or more, is healthy; a persistently high ground-water,
less than five feet from the surface, is unhealthy;
and a fluctuating level, especially if the
changes are sudden and violent, is very unhealthy”
(De Chaumont). Such soils are especially productive
of consumption.</p>


<p class="center">VENTILATION.</p>

<p>The contamination of the atmosphere by the respiration
and bodily emanations of human beings and
other animals is unavoidable, but the noxious matters
thus added to the air are being constantly changed
in the following ways:</p>

<p><b>1. Oxidation.</b> The organic matters, which have
been mentioned as especially injurious, are gradually
decomposed by the oxygen of the air, and
changed into harmless substances, which either remain
as constituents of the atmosphere, or are washed
into the earth by rains.</p>

<p><b>2. Vegetable growth.</b> Plants absorb carbonic
acid (which is composed of carbon and oxy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>gen)
through their leaves, and give back oxygen to
the air, retaining the carbon for their own nourishment.
There is thus a constant interchange between
animals and vegetables, the former exhaling carbonic
acid and appropriating oxygen, and the latter appropriating
carbonic acid and exhaling oxygen. The
small percentage of carbonic acid always found in
the air is, therefore, essential to vegetable life, while
harmless to animals.</p>

<p>It is necessary, for the proper purification of a
contaminated atmosphere, that it should be largely
diluted with fresh air. Hence arises the need of the
constant change of air in dwellings.</p>

<p>Air expands when heated and so becomes lighter.
Local differences of temperature, created by natural
and artificial means, therefore bring about currents
in the atmosphere, the cooler and heavier column of
air always descending, and the warmer and lighter
always rising. This fact is taken advantage of in
ventilation.</p>

<p>It has been estimated that, to keep the air pure,
three thousand cubic feet of fresh air per hour are
required for a male adult, and that a sleeping-room
should contain at least twelve hundred cubic feet of
air-space for each occupant.</p>

<p>When the temperature of the external air is such
that the doors and windows can be constantly open,
they afford the best means of ventilation for dwellings.
An exposure to draughts, however, is dangerous
to many persons, and it is desirable, therefore, in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>
cooler weather, to devise means of admitting fresh
air without creating a draught. At a temperature of
60°, a draught is perceived when the air moves at a
higher rate of speed than three feet a second. Now
it is obvious that a draught may be rendered harmless
if the entering current of air is guided in such a
direction as not to strike the occupants of a room.
This is accomplished simply and cheaply by either
of two devices: If the lower sash of a window is
raised a few inches (say four), and the space between
the bottom of the sash and the window-sill is filled
by an accurately fitted board, there will be a space
between the panes of the two sashes, through which
air will enter, spouting upward toward the ceiling
and not falling until its momentum is so much diminished
that it will not be felt as a draught. The
other plan is to make the upper portion of the upper
sash movable, so that it can be tilted inward at such
an angle as to direct the entering current upward
(essentially the Sherringham valve, though this is
made of iron, with side-cheeks to prevent a lateral
outflow of air).</p>

<p>There are various patent apparatuses for the admission
of fresh air through windows without draught,
but they are mostly modifications of the methods
above mentioned.</p>

<p>In weather when artificial heat is necessary for
comfort, thorough ventilation is not difficult, provided
expense is not considered. As the removal
of the foul air, however, involves a considerable waste<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>
of heat and consumption of fuel, the means of procuring
the best ventilation at the least cost becomes
a problem of great intricacy, which has not yet been
satisfactorily solved.</p>

<p><b>Fireplaces</b>, or open grates, are excellent ventilators.
An ordinary fireplace renews the air of the
room four or five times hourly, removing in that time
from fifteen to twenty thousand cubic feet of air.
But only about 12 or 14 per cent. of the heat given
off by the fuel is utilized, the rest passing off by
the chimney. The objections to the fireplace as a
sole means of heating are, its wastefulness, and the
fact that it warms only by radiation, so that the room
is unequally warmed, and may be too cold in one
place and insupportably hot in another.</p>

<p><b>Stoves</b> and <b>furnaces</b> can not be relied on for
ventilation, the ventilating power of a close stove
being only one tenth of that required for a single
adult.</p>

<p>Modern fireplaces are sometimes built with a metallic
flue extending upward into the chimney. Between
this flue and the masonry is an air-chamber
opening to the external air and communicating with
the room near the ceiling, so that fresh air from outside
the house is continuously warmed, and discharged
into the room at a temperature of 80° or 90°.
The Galton fireplace (Fig. 1) is of this kind, and
utilizes 35 per cent. of the fuel.</p>

<p>The best combined heating and ventilating arrangement
at present seems to be that which warms<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>
the fresh air by means of a soapstone furnace or
steam-coils, and removes the foul air through a fireplace.
In milder weather, gas may be burned in the
chimney at a slight expense. According to Morin,
seven cubic feet of gas burned in a flue eleven inches
square and sixty-six feet high, will draw thirteen
thousand three hundred cubic feet of air per hour
from a room.</p>

  <img class="w100" src="images/image019.jpg" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">Fig. 1.—Galton’s fireplace.</div>
</div>

<p>The <b>dampers</b> of stoves should never be in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>
pipes, for they dam back the gases which ought to
enter the chimney, and force them into the room.
The fire should be regulated by dampers which prevent
the access of air, and not its escape after contamination.</p>

<p>Ventilating <b>flues</b> in walls do very little good, unless
special means are provided to heat them (e. g.,
gas lights or lamps).</p>

<p>The common whirling ventilators in window-panes
are of very little use.</p>

<p>As a rule, fresh air should enter a room near the
ceiling, and foul air be removed near the floor.</p>

<p>In very cold climates, dangerous draughts are
often produced by the cooling of the air in contact
with the window-panes, so that it falls and sweeps
along the floor. This danger may be prevented by
double windows, which also save fuel. Double windows
may be utilized in ventilation, by raising the
lower outer sash a few inches, and lowering the upper
inner one.</p>


<p class="center"><i>Smoky Chimneys.</i></p>

<p>When a chimney smokes, the draught is downward.
This may be, caused—1. By an obstruction
in the flue or stove-pipe. 2. By a higher chimney in
the same house, the air coming down the shorter
chimney, and going up the other. The remedy is to
equalize the heights, or close the doors between the
two. 3. If, when the fire is started, the air outside is
warmer than that in the chimney, the heavier column<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>
will of course fall. This effect will vanish in a few
minutes, when the flue becomes heated. 4. The
doors and windows of the room may be so tight as
to prevent a sufficient supply of fresh air to burn the
fuel. If so, they must be opened. 5. The chimney
may be lower than the adjoining wall, and the wind
from certain directions, striking the wall, may be directed
down the flues. This may be remedied by
extending the chimney above the wall, or by capping
the flues with one of the various cowls that prevent
a downward draught.</p>

<small>DRAINAGE.</small></h2>
</div>

<p><b>How to prevent the contamination of the
air by the products of decomposition.</b></p>

<p>There is no evidence to show that the emanations
from fresh house-slops, or the excreta of healthy
animals, are injurious to health, but it has been
proved that when these matters decompose they become
dangerous. The bubbles of gas which rise to
the surface of such decomposing matters, when they
burst, throw up solid particles of organic matter in
the air, which float about for some time before falling
to the ground. It is, therefore, essential to
health that all such matters shall be removed from
the vicinity of human beings promptly, before de<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>composition
sets in, or else so manipulated as to prevent
decomposition, or promote rapid oxidation.</p>

<p>The lower animals seem to recognize by instinct
that their excreta are dangerous, and they deposit
them (except when penned up by men) in places remote
from their abodes, or else carefully cover them
with fresh earth. Man alone retains his excreta in
carefully prepared receptacles near his place of residence,
until the accumulation is so large that he is
forced to remove it.</p>

<p>The ordinary <b>privy-vault</b> should never be allowed.
Its only advantage is its cheapness, while it
involves constant danger of contamination of the
water of adjoining wells or cisterns. Many an epidemic
of typhoid fever has been unmistakably traced
to this source. If such a vault is a necessity, it
should be made water-tight, be small and frequently
emptied, the contents should be frequently disinfected,
preferably by being covered with fresh earth,
and it should be built in such a spot that the current
of ground-water (which furnishes the well-water)
shall be from the well toward the vault, and never in
the opposite direction. Better still is a <b>movable
tank</b>, in which the excreta are received and covered
with fresh earth daily. This can be emptied over a
garden or field without offense. In villages where
sewerage is impossible, <b>pails</b> are sometimes used.
They have tight covers, and are removed frequently
(once or twice a week, clean ones being substituted
at the time of removal by the proper authorities),<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>
the contents being converted into poudrette at some
place remote from habitations.</p>

<p>A better means of disposing of the excreta, where
water-closets can not be had, is the <b>earth-closet</b>,
of which there are several varieties. These are so
constructed that they resemble a water-closet in appearance,
but the excreta are caught in a receptacle
beneath the seat, and covered with earth, when the
handle beside the seat is raised. Dry earth is an
excellent disinfectant,<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> and when excreta are thus
mingled with it they are gradually oxidized and disappear,
so that after a time the same earth may, with
proper precautions, be used again.</p>

<div class="footnotes">
<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_1" href="#FNanchor_1" class="label">[1]</a> Its disinfectant properties have been shown to be due to
the presence of microscopic organisms, which decompose the
excreta in the act of nourishing themselves. A little chloroform
paralyzes them, and deprives the earth of its disinfecting
properties, which return, however, when the chloroform is
washed out, and the organisms recover their natural vigor.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>The earth for these closets must be dry, and
sifted of coarse particles, and enough must be deposited
upon the excreta to cover them and to absorb
the urine.</p>

<p>Its advantages, as compared with the water-closet,
are, that it is cheaper, requires less repair, is not
hurt by frost, is not injured when improper substances
are thrown down it, and requires no water.
Its disadvantages are, the trouble of collecting and
drying the earth, the necessity of frequently removing
the soil, the dust sometimes caused by its use,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>
and the necessity of providing additional means for
the disposal of slops.</p>

<p>A perfect method of disposal of excreta and
other house refuse would be one which would insure
their prompt and rapid removal in such a way
as to prevent the contamination of the air of any
inhabited locality during such removal, or after their
final deposition. The most convenient and economical
means yet invented of accomplishing this object
is <b>water-carriage</b>; i. e., the matters referred to are
conveyed from the house, with the addition of sufficient
water to insure a rapid flow, through a series of
pipes and tunnels into a large body of running water,
or over the surface of the earth, under conditions
which insure their rapid conversion into harmless substances.</p>

<p>The water-carriage system includes bowls or
sinks for the deposit of refuse matters, connecting-pipes
to remove such matters from the house, and
public sewers for their further conveyance away
from human abodes. The construction and care of
public sewers belong to the local government; we
have here only to do with house-drainage.</p>

<p>The essentials of house-drainage are: 1. The
primary receptacles (bowls, sinks, water-closets, etc.)
should be of such material and so constructed as to
be impervious to fluids, and easy to clean and keep
clean. 2. The pipes should be of such material as
to be as durable as possible, and so laid and connected
as to form gas-tight conduits, and to insure<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>
the rapid passage of whatever enters them, so as to
prevent the formation of deposits or incrustations.
3. The drainage system should be so planned and
constructed that neither the atmosphere of the house
nor the drinking-water can be polluted by anything
escaping from it, and no noxious matters can enter
it from any other house.</p>


<p>The following plan of construction is that recommended
by the Board of Health of New York
city:</p>

<p>1. All materials must be of good quality and free
from defects; the work must be executed in a thorough
and workmanlike manner.</p>

<p>2. The arrangement of soil and waste pipes must
be as direct as possible.</p>

<p>3. The drain, soil, and waste pipes, and the traps,
must, if practicable, be exposed to view for ready
inspection at all times, and for convenience in repairing.
When necessarily placed within partitions
or in recesses of walls, soil and waste pipes must be
covered with wood-work, so fastened with screws as
to be readily removed. In no case shall they be
absolutely inaccessible.</p>

<p>4. It is recommended to place the soil and other
vertical pipes in a special shaft, between or adjacent
to the water-closet and the bath-room, and serving
as a ventilating shaft for them. This shaft should
be at least two and a half feet square. It should
extend from the cellar through the roof, and should
be covered by a louvered sky-light. It should be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>
accessible at every story, and should have a very
open but strong grating at each floor to stand upon.</p>

<p>Shafts not less than three feet square in area are
required in tenement-houses, to ventilate interior
water-closets.</p>

<p>5. Every house or building must be separately
and independently connected with the street-sewer.</p>

<p>6. Where the ground is made or filled in, the
house-sewer—that is to say, the portion of the drain
extending from the public sewer to the front wall—must
be of cast-iron, with the joints properly calked
with lead.</p>

<p>7. Where the soil consists of a natural bed of
loam, sand, or rock, the house-sewer may be of hard,
salt-glazed, and cylindrical earthenware pipe, laid on
a smooth bottom, free from all projections of rock,
and with the soil well rammed to prevent any settling
of the pipe. Each section must be wetted before
applying the cement, and the space between
each hub and the small end of the next section must
be completely and uniformly filled with the best
hydraulic cement. Care must be taken to prevent
any cement being forced into the drain to become
an obstruction. No tempered-up cement shall be
used. A straight-edge must be used inside the pipe,
and the different sections must be laid in perfect
line on the bottom and sides.</p>

<p>8. Where there is no sewer in the street, and it
is necessary to construct a private sewer to connect
with a sewer on an adjacent street or avenue, it must<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>
be laid under the roadway of the street on which the
houses front, and not through the yards or under
the houses.</p>

<p>9. The house-drain must be of iron, with a fall
of at least one quarter inch to the foot, if possible,
and not more than one inch to the foot.</p>

<p>10. Where water-closets or a school-sink discharge
into it, the drain must be at least four inches
in diameter.</p>

<p>11. It must be hung on the cellar wall or ceiling,
unless this is impracticable, in which case it must be
laid in a trench cut at a uniform grade, walled upon
the sides with brick laid in hydraulic cement, and
provided with movable covers, and with a hydraulic
concrete base of four inches in thickness, on which
the pipe is to rest.</p>

<p>12. It must be laid in a straight line, if possible.
All changes in direction must be made with curved
pipes, and all connections with Y-branch pipes and
one-eighth bends.</p>

<p>13. Any house-drain or house-sewer, put in and
covered without due notice to the Health Department,
must be uncovered for inspection at the direction
of the inspector.</p>

<p>14. A running or half S-trap must be placed on
the house-drain at an accessible point near the front
of the house. This trap must be furnished with a
hand-hole for convenience in cleaning, the cover of
which must be properly fitted and made gas and air
tight with some proper cement.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span></p>

<p>15. There must be an inlet for fresh air entering
the drain just inside the trap, of at least four inches
in diameter, leading to the outer air and opening at
or near the street curb, or at a convenient place not
less than ten feet from the nearest window. No
cold-air box for a furnace shall be so placed that it
can by any possibility draw air from this inlet-pipe.
The inlet-pipe should never be carried up to the
roof inside or outside the house.</p>

<p>16. No brick, sheet-metal, earthenware, or chimney-flue
shall be used as a sewer-ventilator, nor to
ventilate any trap, drain, soil, or waste pipe.</p>

<p>17. Every vertical soil-pipe and waste-pipe must
be of iron, and, where it receives the discharge
of fixtures on two or more floors, it must be extended
at least two feet above the highest part
of the roof or coping, of undiminished size, with
a return bend or cowl. It must not open near
a window, nor an air-shaft which ventilates livingrooms.</p>

<p>18. Soil, waste, and vent pipes, in an extension,
must be extended above the roof of the main building,
when otherwise they would open within twenty
feet of the windows of the main house or the adjoining
house.</p>

<p>19. Horizontal soil and waste pipes are prohibited.</p>

<p>20. The minimum diameter of soil-pipe permitted
is four inches. A vertical waste-pipe, into
which a line of kitchen-sinks discharge, must be at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>
least two inches in diameter, with one inch and a
half branches.</p>

<p>21. Where lead pipe is used to connect fixtures
with vertical soil or waste pipes, or to connect traps
with vertical vent-pipes, it must not be lighter than
D-pipe.</p>

<p>22. There shall be no traps on vertical soil-pipes
or vertical waste-pipes.</p>

<p>23. All iron pipes must be sound, free from holes,
and of a uniform thickness of not less than one eighth
of an inch for a diameter of two, three, or four inches,
or five thirty-seconds of an inch for a diameter of
five or six inches; and, in case the building is over
sixty-five feet in height above the curb, the use of
what is known as extra heavy pipe, and corresponding
fittings, are required, which weigh as follows:</p>

<p>24. Before they are connected they must be thoroughly
coated inside and outside with coal-tar pitch,
applied hot, or some other equivalent substance.</p>

<p>25. When required by an inspector from the
Board of Health, the plumbing must be tested with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>
the peppermint or the water test, by the plumber in
the presence of the inspector, and all defective joints
made tight, and other openings made impermeable
to gases. Defective pipe discovered must be removed
and replaced by sound pipe.</p>

<p>26. All joints in the iron drain-pipes, soil-pipes,
and waste-pipes must be so calked with oakum and
lead, or with cement made of iron filings and sal-ammoniac,
as to make them impermeable to gas.</p>

<p>27. All connections of lead with iron pipes must
be made with a brass sleeve or ferrule, of the same
size as the lead pipe, put in the hub of the branch
of the iron pipe, and calked in with lead. The
lead pipe must be attached to the ferrule by a wiped
joint.</p>

<p>28. All connections of lead pipe should be by
wiped joints.</p>

<p>29. Every water-closet, urinal, sink, basin, wash-tray,
bath, and every tub or set of tubs, must be
separately and effectively trapped, except where a
sink and wash-tubs immediately adjoin each other,
in which case the waste-pipe from the tubs may be
connected with the inlet side of the sink-trap; in
such a case the tub waste-pipe is not required to be
separately trapped.</p>

<p>30. Traps must be placed as near the fixtures as
practicable, and in no case shall a trap be more than
two feet from the fixture.</p>

<p>31. All exit-pipes must be provided with strong
metallic strainers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span></p>

<p>32. In no case shall the waste from a bath-tub or
other fixture be connected with a water-closet trap.</p>

<p>33. Traps must be protected from siphonage, and
the waste-pipe leading from them ventilated, by a
special air-pipe, in no case less than two inches in
diameter for water-closet traps, and one inch and a
half for other traps. Except in private dwellings,
the vertical vent-pipes for traps of water-closets in
buildings more than four stories in height must be at
least three inches in diameter, with two-inch branches
to each trap, and for traps of other fixtures not less
than two inches in diameter, with branches one and
a half inches in diameter, unless the trap is smaller,
in which case the diameter of branch vent-pipe must
be at least equal to the diameter of the trap. In all
cases vertical vent-pipes must be of cast or wrought
iron.</p>

<p>34. These pipes must either extend two feet above
the highest part of the roof or coping, the extension
to be not less than four inches in diameter to avoid
obstruction from frost, or they may be branched into
a soil-pipe above the inlet from the highest fixture.
They may be combined by branching together those
which serve several traps. These air-pipes must always
have a continuous slope, to avoid collecting
water by condensation.</p>

<p>35. Traps of fixtures near the fresh-air inlet may
be ventilated by being connected with it.</p>

<p>36. No trap vent-pipe shall be used as a waste or
soil pipe.</p>

<p>37. Overflow-pipes from fixtures must, in each
case, be connected on the inlet side of the trap.</p>

<p>38. Every safe under a wash-basin, bath, urinal,
water-closet, or other fixture, must be drained by a
special pipe not directly connected with any soil-pipe,
waste-pipe, drain, or sewer, but discharging
into an open sink, upon the cellar-floor, or outside
the house.</p>

<p>39. The waste-pipe from a refrigerator shall not
be directly connected with the soil or waste pipe, or
with the drain or sewer, or discharge into the soil;
it should discharge into an open sink. Such waste-pipes
should be so arranged as to admit of frequent
flushing, and should be as short as possible, and disconnected
from the refrigerator.</p>

<p>40. The sediment-pipe from kitchen boilers must
be connected on the inlet side of the sink-trap.</p>

<p>41. All water-closets within the house must be
supplied with water from special tanks or cisterns,
the water of which is not used for any other purpose.
The closets must never be supplied directly
from the Croton supply-pipes. A group of closets
may be supplied from one tank; but water-closets
on different floors are not permitted to be flushed
from one tank.</p>

<p>42. The valves of cisterns must be so fitted and
adjusted as to prevent wasting of water, especially
where cisterns are supplied from a tank on the roof.</p>

<p>43. The overflow-pipes from water-closet cisterns
must discharge into an open sink, or where its dis<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span>charge
will attract attention and indicate that waste
of water is occurring, but not into the bowl of the
water-closet, not into the soil or waste pipe, nor into
the drain or sewer. When the pressure of the Croton
is not sufficient to supply these tanks, a pump must
be provided.</p>

<p>44. Tanks for drinking-water are objectionable;
if indispensable, they must never be lined with lead,
galvanized iron, or zinc. They should be constructed
of iron, or wood lined with tinned and planished
copper. The overflow should discharge upon the
roof, or be trapped and discharge into an open sink,
never into any soil or waste pipe or water-closet trap,
nor into the drain or sewer.</p>

<p>45. Rain-water leaders must never be used as
soil, waste, or vent pipes; nor shall any soil, waste,
or vent pipe be used as a leader.</p>

<p>46. When within the house, the leader must be
of cast-iron, with leaded joints; when outside of the
house, and connected with the house-drain, it must
be trapped beneath the ground or just inside of the
wall, the trap being arranged in either case so as to
prevent freezing. In every case where a leader opens
near a window or a light-shaft, it must be properly
trapped at its base.</p>

<p>47. No steam exhaust or blow-off pipe from a
steam-boiler will be allowed to connect with any soil
or waste pipe, or directly with the house-drain. They
should discharge into a tank or condenser, the waste
from which, if to be discharged into the sewer through<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>
the house-drain, must be connected on the sewer
side of the running trap.</p>

<p>48. Subsoil drains must be provided whenever
necessary.</p>

<p>49. Yards and areas should always be properly
graded, cemented, flagged, or well paved, and properly
drained; when the drain is connected with the
house-drain, it must be effectively trapped. Front-area
drains must, where practicable, be connected
with the house-drain inside of the running trap.</p>

<p>50. Cellar and foundation walls must, where possible,
be rendered impervious to dampness, and the
use of asphaltum or coal-tar pitch, in addition to
hydraulic cement, is recommended for that purpose.</p>

<p>51. No privy-vault or school-sink will be allowed
in any cellar or basement; nor shall the general privy
accommodation of a tenement or lodging house be
allowed to be in the cellar or basement.</p>

<p>52. No privy-vault, or cesspool for sewage, will
be permitted in any part of the city where water-closets
or a school-sink can be connected with a
public sewer in the street.</p>

<p>53. School-sinks must be of cast-iron, not more
than two feet in depth, connected at the upper end
with the Croton supply, and at the lower end with a
drain leading to the street-sewer, and provided with
an outlet at the lowest point and on the bottom so
as to admit of a complete discharge of the contents
whenever the outlet is opened and the sink flushed
with water.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span></p>

<p>54. The sink must be set so that the flange will
be at least two feet below the yard surface, to prevent
freezing. It must be at least ten feet from any
window, or as near that distance as practicable.</p>

<p>55. The waste-pipe from a hydrant-sink in the
yard must be properly trapped, especially where it
discharges into a school-sink, a privy-vault, or cesspool,
or the house-drain.</p>

<p>56. Open light and air courts must be properly
drained.</p>

<p>57. When a privy-vault or cesspool must necessarily
be used, and the water-supply of the premises
is from a well, they must be at least fifty feet from
the well; and the privy-vault must be absolutely
tight.</p>


<p class="center"><i>Explanatory Remarks.</i></p>

<p>2. <b>As direct as possible.</b> To insure an uninterrupted

(a beam or post) an <b>offset</b> is used (Fig. 2).</p>

<p>3. The <b>soil-pipe</b> is that which conveys the contents

are intended to carry other refuse fluids only.
The <b>house-drain</b> is the large pipe which receives
the contents of the soil and waste pipes and conveys
them outside the house.</p>

<p>A <b>trap</b> is a bend (with or without an enlargement)
of the pipe, intended to retain a sufficient
amount of the fluids that enter it to occlude the pipe
and prevent the backward flow of air. The effective<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>

<p>4. A <b>louvered sky-light</b> is one with slats at the
sides inclining outward, so that air can escape but
rain can not enter.</p>

<p>6. <b>Calked with lead.</b> (See 26.)</p>

<p>7. <b>Tempered-up cement.</b> Cement which has
been used once, and has been broken up and ground,
for using a second time.</p>

<p>9. <b>House-drain</b>, of iron. (See “Bad Odors,
2, <i>a</i>.”)</p>

<p>10. <b>Water-closets.</b> Four principal classes,
with innumerable varieties, mostly patented.</p>

<p>1. The <b>pan-closet</b> (Fig. 16). Its chief advantage
is its cheapness and the ease with which it can
be repaired. Its disadvantage is the odor that usually
attends its use. When the handle (<i>a</i>) is raised,
the contents of the pan (<i>b</i>) are thrown against the
side of the iron container (<i>c</i>), and some filth adheres
there and decomposes, filling the container with a
noisome stench, which escapes into the room every
time the closet is used. An abundant flush, an en<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span>ameled
container, and proper ventilation of the container,
reduce this nuisance materially. Generally
condemned by sanitarians.</p>

<div class="figcenter illowp100" id="image" style="max-width: 50em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/image040.jpg" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><span class="g4r">Fig. 16.—Pan-closet.</span> Fig. 17.—Hopper-closet.</div>
</div>

<p>2. <b>Hopper-closets</b> (Fig. 17). Rather unsightly,
because the water and floating matter in the trap
are visible, and matters often cling to the sides, but,
with an abundant flush suddenly discharged, are very
inoffensive.</p>

<p>3. <b>Plunger-closets</b>, of which the Jennings closet
(Fig. 18) may be taken as a type. The handle lifts a
plug, which allows the contents of the bowl to run
out, and, when the plug is dropped in place, the bowl
is filled again from a ball-cock. These closets are
liable to get out of order; the plungers or plugs lose
their rubber flanges and leak, and the plunger-chamber
is apt to retain filth.</p>

<div class="figcenter illowp90" id="image041a" style="max-width: 62.5em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/image041a.jpg" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">Fig. 18.—Jennings closet.</div>
</div>

<p>4. It is evident that if the hopper-closet could
have its trap bent to one side out of sight, and its
hopper enlarged toward the bottom, so that nothing
would strike and cling to its sides, it would be an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>
excellent one. Of such a type are the Tidal-Wave and
National closets (Fig. 19), <i>a</i> being the water-pipe,
which discharges into a flushing rim, and <i>b</i> a vent-pipe
to relieve pressure between the two bodies of
water during a discharge, and prevent siphoning.</p>

<div class="figcenter illowp100" id="image041" style="max-width: 62.5em;">

<div class="caption"><span class="g2r">Fig. 19.—Tidal-wave closet.</span> <span class="g2r">Fig. 20.—Y-branch.
</span> Fig. 21.—Quarter bend.</div>
</div>

<p>A water-closet, to be well flushed, should have a
discharge of three gallons of water in five seconds,
sent directly downward all around the rim.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span></p>


<p><b>School-sink</b> (also called trough-sink or privy-sink).
An iron trough, having a sewer-connected
opening with a movable iron plug in the bottom at
one end, for the discharge of its contents, and a pipe
at the other end, from which it is filled with water.
It is practically an elongated water-closet. (See 53.)</p>

<p>12. <b>Y-branch</b> (Fig. 20), so named from its shape.
There are also half Y-branches.</p>

<p><b>Eighth bends.</b> There are also quarter bends
(Fig. 21), sixth bends, and sixteenth bends. These
are used in pipe-connections in order to discharge
the contents of the branch pipes in the same general
direction with the current in the main pipes, for, if
the discharge enters at a right angle, a deposit is apt
to form opposite the point of connection.</p>

<p>14. <b>Trap in house-drain.</b> Intended to cut off
all communication between the house and the street
sewer. If a contagious disease occurs in one’s own
house, he can be sure that the excreta are disinfected,
and that disease-germs can not escape into the air,
even if the pipes happen to be defective; but he can
not be sure that such excreta are properly disinfected
in other houses. The only safe way, therefore, is
for each house to be cut off from all others by the
means described. The objections to the trap on the
house-drain are, that it forms a slight obstruction to
the flow of drainage, and is liable to be obstructed by
deposits, and that it favors “cushioning,” i. e., the
forcing of smaller traps, when the air in the drain is
compressed between this trap and a down-coming<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>
mass of water. (See “Bad Odors,” 1, <i>d</i>.) The first
of these objections is met by making the trap a
half S one, so that the fluids fall down one limb with
sufficient force to wash out the bottom of the trap
thoroughly with each discharge, and the second by
the fresh-air inlet, which relieves the pressure that
otherwise might force the traps.</p>

<p>15. The <b>fresh-air inlet</b> affords free entrance for
air, and, as the main lines of pipe are open above the
roof, the difference in length of the pipes will give
rise to a constant current of fresh air through them,
in one direction or the other. (See “Bad Odors,”
1 <i>c</i>.) This results in the oxidation of whatever filth
may cling to the pipes, and dilutes offensive gases so
that they are rendered harmless. It has also been
shown that the various microscopic organisms, which
are believed to be the specific cause of certain diseases,
increase in virulence, when they propagate in
the absence or with a deficient supply of oxygen,
while the intensity of their action is diminished if
they grow where oxygen is plentiful.</p>

<p>16. <b>Ventilation in chimney-flues.</b> (See “Bad
Odors,” 1, <i>c</i>.)</p>

<p>17. <b>Vertical pipes of iron.</b> Iron resists corrosion
and the assaults of rats better than lead, and
lead pipes are sometimes occluded by pressure and
settling. Branch wastes are generally of lead because
it is easily cut and bent, so as to be used in
difficult situations.</p>

<p><b>Return-bend</b> or <b>cowl</b>. To prevent senseless<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>
persons from throwing things down the pipe, and
thus obstructing it.</p>

<p>20. <b>Diameter of pipes.</b> The inside diameter
is always meant.</p>

<p>21. <b>D-pipe.</b> (See Appendix B.)</p>

<p>22. <b>No traps on vertical pipes</b>,i. e., at the
foot of such pipes, because they would prevent the
free circulation of air, and thus render the fresh-air
inlet practically useless. Also to prevent “cushioning.”</p>

<p>23. <b>Cast-iron</b> pipes are made in five-foot lengths,
with an enlargement at one end, called the hub or
bell, and a bead around the edge of the other end
(the spigot-end). The spigot-end of one pipe fits
loosely into the hub of another, sufficient room being
left for calking. (See 26.)</p>

<p>24. <b>Pipes</b> are <b>tarred</b> by being heated to 500°
Fahr. and then dipped perpendicularly into a hot
bath of coal-tar pitch mixed with a small proportion
of heavy coal-oil. This coating prevents corrosion,
or at least greatly retards it.</p>

<p>25. <b>Wrought-iron pipes</b>, with screw joints, are
used by the Durham House Drainage Company, the
joints being gas-tight. They have the advantage of being
very durable and impervious to gases, but the disadvantage
of being too permanent. If it is desired
to change the position of a fixture, or to connect a
new one, it is easy to break a hole in a cast-iron pipe,
or to remove a portion of it, but where wrought-iron
pipe is used this is almost impossible. The Durham<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>
system also costs about twenty-five per cent more
than the common one, and it is not strictly correct
to say that its use renders a house absolutely secure
against leakage of sewer-air, because it does not
do away with lead branch-pipes, in which frequent
leakages occur, and all irregular portions of pipe,
with branches, etc., in this system are made of cast-iron
with calked joints, as in the ordinary system.</p>

<p>The <b>water-test</b> is applied by plugging the pipe
carefully, and closing all openings below a certain
point, and then filling it with water to that level. If
there is any leakage, the water-level will gradually
sink. If the pipes are tight, it will remain the same.</p>

<p><b>Peppermint-test.</b> (See hereafter.)</p>

<p>26. Oakum is packed into the space between the
spigot-end of one pipe and the hub of the other, and
driven against the bead above mentioned. This
packing is called a <b>gasket</b>. Melted lead is poured
in on top of the oakum, and, when it has cooled, is
driven in tight with a calking iron and mallet. When
ordinary pipe is used, the calking will sometimes
split the hub, and this furnishes an argument for the
general use of extra-heavy pipe.</p>

<p><b>Iron-filings</b>, etc., making what is called a <b>rust-joint</b>.</p>

<p>27. <b>Ferrules</b>, or <b>sleeves</b>, are used because lead
pipes are too soft and yielding to withstand the calking.
Lead can not be soldered to iron, and therefore
brass or copper has to be used. If iron ferrules are
used, the lead pipe must be turned up on the outside<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>
far enough so that its edge shall be covered by the
melted lead used in calking, so as to prevent leakage
of gas, as hereafter described. (See “Bad Odors,”
1, <i>b</i>.)</p>

<p>28. <b>Wiped-joints</b> are those always used for lead
pipe, and are indicated by a raised ring of solder
surrounding the pipe.</p>

<p>29. A <b>trap</b>, with a good water-seal, is an effective
barrier against the passage of sewer-air or particles
of organic matter. The experiments of Carmichael,
confirmed by Wernich and Pumpelly, have
amply demonstrated that sewer-air passes through
the water-seal in such minute quantities that it can
not possibly harm any one, and that solid particles
of matter can not pass at all.</p>

<p><b>Separate traps</b>, except, etc. (See “Bad Odors,”
1, <i>d</i>.)</p>

<p>33. <b>Siphonage</b>. (See “Bad Odors,” 1, <i>d</i> 37.)</p>

<p>37. <b>Overflow-pipes</b> from fixtures. It is better
to connect them with the trap below the water-level.
(See “Bad Odors,” 1, <i>d</i>.)</p>

<p>38. <b>Safes</b> are sheets of metal (generally lead)
with turned-up edges, placed beneath basins, sinks,
water-closets, etc., to protect the floor in case of
leakage. The waste-pipes of safes are common
sources of nuisance. (See “Bad Odors,” 1, <i>c</i>.)</p>

<p>39. To prevent contamination of the contents of
the refrigerator.</p>

<p>41. When water-closets are flushed directly from
the common supply-pipe of the house, as in the dif<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span>ferent
kinds of valve-closets, the water in the pipes,
under certain circumstances, will be contaminated:
e. g., if a person opens a faucet on one floor at the
same moment that the valve is opened to flush a
water-closet on a higher floor, water will be sucked
back from the valve, and the air of the closet will
follow it. Check-valves have been used to prevent
this, but they should not be depended on.</p>

<p>Various forms of <b>tanks</b> or <b>cisterns</b> for water-closets
are here shown. Fig. 22 represents a tank,
<i>b</i>, which discharges water as long as the handle (attached
to the chain <i>a</i>) is raised. It gives a flush also
of the entire contents of the service-box <i>c</i>, after the
handle is lowered. Fig. 23 shows a waste-preventing
tank, which is divided into two compartments, <i>b</i> and
<i>d</i>. It will be seen that this allows only the contents
of <i>d</i> to be discharged, with an after-flush from <i>c</i>.
Fig. 24 shows a tank, in which the chain <i>a</i> is attached<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span>
to the seat, and is pulled down when the seat is depressed.
It will be seen that no water can flow
while the closet is in use, but, when the seat is released,
the contents of <i>c</i> are discharged with great
force. In all these figures, <i>e</i> is a ball-cock. This
cock is controlled by a hollow copper ball, which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>
floats on water, and is attached to the end of a lever.
When the water falls, the ball falls with it, and opens
the cock. When it is floated up to a certain point,
it closes the cock and stops the flow.</p>

<p>45. <b>Leaders</b> should not be used as soil-pipes,
because, during a rain, the ventilation of the pipes
is interfered with by the downward flow of water,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span>
which will also empty unventilated traps by siphoning.
The necessity of having leaders open flush with
the roof also interferes with proper ventilation.</p>

<p>47. If <b>steam</b> enters a soil-pipe, it heats the water
in the traps, injures joints on account of the extreme
changes of temperature induced, and hastens corrosion
of the pipes.</p>

<p>In <b>country houses</b>, where there are no sewers,
the best method of disposing of the house-slops is
<b>subsoil drainage</b>. The house system may be the
same as that already explained for city houses. The
fluids are conducted by a pipe with tight joints to a
<b>flush-tank</b> (Fig. 26) near the house. This tank is
so constructed that it empties itself, by a siphon
action, whenever it gets full, discharging all its contents
in a very short time, and thus washing out<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span>
thoroughly the pipes into which it empties. “The
outlet-pipe from this tank is continued by a cemented
vitrified pipe to a point about twenty-five feet farther
away. Here it connects with a system of open-jointed
drain-tiles, consisting of one main, fifty feet
long, and ten lateral drains, six feet apart, and each
about twenty feet long. These drains underlie a
part of the lawn, and are only about ten inches below
the surface” (Waring). It will be understood that
the purpose of this method of drainage is to have
the organic matter contained in the house-refuse
appropriated by vegetation, and it must therefore be
distributed within reach of the grass-roots.</p>

<p>If water-closets are used, the following system is
recommended in “The Sanitary Engineer”: Collect
all the sewage of the house in a small and perfectly
tight tank or cesspool, in which the paper and fecal
matter soon become macerated by fermentation and
reduced to a pulp. This tank should overflow into
the flush-tank, the overflow-pipe dipping at least a
foot below the point of discharge, to avoid the scum.
The siphon of the flush-tank should be accessible
by a man-hole, so as to be readily cleaned. If thus
arranged, and if no roots of trees are in the soil, the
distribution-pipes will not clog for a year or more,
sometimes not for ten years.</p>

<p>Pipes should be laid at a depth of eight inches,
with a slight and uniform descent of not over six or
eight inches in one hundred feet. Branches from
a four-inch main to the two-inch distribution-pipes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span>
should lead from the bottom of the former, instead
of from the side, as in ordinary drain connections.</p>

<p>There should be a grease-trap (see “Explanatory
Remarks,” 3) attached to the kitchen waste-pipes,
in order to prevent clogging of the tanks and pipes
by the congelation of fat.</p>


<p class="center"><i>Bad Odors.</i></p>

<p><b>When bad odors in a house are traceable
to the drainage, they will usually be found
to be due to one or more of the following
causes</b>:</p>

<p>1. <b>To faulty construction.</b> (<i>a.</i>) <b>Drains.</b>—These
may be made of brick or stone and cement.
Such materials are pervious to gases, even when
sound, and are peculiarly liable to be channeled by
rats, especially where an iron or lead pipe enters
them. Such a drain should be replaced by an iron
one.</p>

<div class="figright illowp25" id="image053" style="max-width: 12.5em;">
  <img  src="images/image053.jpg" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">Fig. 27.—Iron ferrule improperly calked.</div>
</div>

<p>(<i>b.</i>) <b>Joints.</b>—<b>Cement-joints</b> are pervious to
gases. <b>Putty-joints</b> crack and so become pervious.
A <b>lead</b> pipe is sometimes connected with an <b>iron</b>
one by means of an iron ferrule, the lead pipe passing
inside the ferrule and being turned over its lower
edge, extending up on the outside, the ferrule then
being calked into the hub. When paper is used for
the gasket or packing, it rots away in time, and a
passage is left through which gas can escape as follows:
up between the hub and the turned-over lead
pipe, over its edge, between it and the calking, down<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>
between the lead pipe and the ferrule, across the
lower edge of the ferrule, and out between the inner
surface of the ferrule and the outer
surface of the lead pipe. (See Fig.
27.) Sometimes a connection of lead
with iron is made by means of a <b>lead
flange</b> fastened around the iron pipe
with wire, and sometimes the lead
pipe is simply stuck into a hole in the
iron pipe and fastened with cement
or putty. Such work should be replaced
by properly made joints as
described in the above regulations. (Or in “Bad
Odors,” 2, <i>c</i>.)</p>

<p>(<i>c.</i>) <b>Pipes.</b>—If the <b>leaders</b> are not trapped at
the bottom, offensive gases from them may enter the
nearest windows. A leader is never of the same
length as the soil-pipe, and, if there is direct communication
between them through the house-drain,
there will always be a current of air through them in
one direction or the other. If the external air is
colder than that inside the pipes, then the heavier
column of air will be over the shorter pipe, and the
current will be down that one and up the other. If
the external air is warmer than that in the pipes, the
heavier column will be that which includes the longer
pipe, and the current will be down that one and up
the shorter. So, as a rule, the current in winter is
down the short pipe and up the long one, while in
summer it is reversed, and, as the short pipe often<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>
ends near windows, the nuisance is greatest when
these windows are open. Of course, in such cases,
the leader must be trapped.</p>

<p><b>Ventilating-pipes</b> sometimes end in chimney-flues.
This is a bad plan, for, if the flue is in use,
the open end of the pipe will become choked with
soot and finally be rendered useless. If the flue is
not used, there will often be a down draught in it,
and the offensive gases may be conveyed through
stove-pipes or fireplaces into the rooms of the house.
Such gases may even penetrate the walls of the flue
and so enter the house. If such a pipe is ever run
into a flue, it should be extended at least two feet
above the chimney-top.</p>

<p>Ventilating-pipes are sometimes badly arranged,
so that they actually neutralize a trap and render it
useless. (See Fig. 28.) In this figure <i>a</i> is the soil-pipe
and <i>b</i> the ventilating-pipe.</p>
<div class="figcenter illowp80" id="image055" style="max-width: 50em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/image055.jpg" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">Fig. 28.—Faulty arrangement of ventilating pipes.</div>
</div>

<p><b>Safe-wastes</b> and the <b>overflow-pipes</b> of tanks
and cisterns may be connected with the soil or waste
pipe. When they are, they are usually trapped. It
will often be found that the traps are empty and
useless, so that offensive gases escape from the pipes.
With tank-overflow pipes this is generally the case.
Safe-waste traps are sometimes provided with small
feed-pipes, intended to discharge water into them
every time the fixtures are used. It will often be
found, however, if the end of the feed-pipe is pulled
up out of the waste, that no water runs through it,
and it is useless, sometimes because it is too small<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span>
and is choked with dust and sediment, and sometimes
because it is wrongly attached to the source of
supply. Safe-wastes, discharging into the kitchen or
cellar, may convey to the rooms odors of cooking or
of articles stored in the cellar (onions, turnips, etc.),
or from the servants’ water-closet, which is often
offensive. If urine or other offensive liquids from
leakage flow through them, the upward currents of
air will be impregnated with odors from the filth that
has clung to the pipe long after the leak has been
repaired. In any event these safe-wastes constitute
a direct communication between different rooms of
a house, which is not always desirable. It is better
to do without them. They are rarely of any use. If<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span>
required, however, they should either be trapped
under the safe, and means taken to insure a constant
water-seal, or they may be closed by a piece of paper
pasted over the lower opening, which will prevent
the entrance of any odors from cellar or kitchen, but
will give way in case of leakage. The safe-wastes of
water-closets often discharge into the trap of the
water-closet. This is a bad plan, because, if there
is an obstruction in the trap, the safe-waste is, of
course, useless. If offensive odors are traced to
safe-wastes, the openings had better be sealed. If
overflow-pipes are the source, they must be disconnected
from the soil or waste pipe and made to discharge
elsewhere (e. g., into some sink or water-closet).</p>

  <img class="w100" src="images/image056.jpg" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">Fig. 29.—Cushioning illustrated.</div>
</div>

<p>(<i>d.</i>) <b>Traps.</b>—If two traps are so arranged that
the air is compressed between them by an oncoming
rush of water, the trap containing the shallowest water-seal
will be forced, and a certain amount of air
will escape through it from the interior of the pipe.
This result is due to “cushioning,” as it is called,
and is illustrated in Fig. 29. Such a fault is to be
remedied by connecting the crown of one of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span>
traps with a ventilating-pipe, so that any pressure of
the kind is immediately relieved without disturbing
the seal of the trap.</p>

<div class="figcenter illowp90" id="image057" style="max-width: 62.5em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/image057.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"> <span class="g4r">Fig. 30.—Double-trapped waste-pipe
(air-bound).</span>  Fig. 31.—Two sinks with but one trap.</div>
</div>

<p>If there are two traps on the same line of pipe
(Fig. 30), so that a part of the interior of the pipe is
cut off from the external air in both directions, it
becomes “air-bound,” and one of two results will
follow, viz.: water discharged into the fixture above
the higher trap will remain in the bowl and not run
down, on account of the compression of air between
the traps; or, if it does run out of the fixture, it will
displace an equivalent bulk of foul air, which will
bubble up through the upper trap and cause offen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span>sive
odors. In such a case, the lower trap should
be removed.</p>

<p>If <b>two</b> or <b>more waste-pipes</b> (as in sets of tubs,
in sinks, and often in urinals) are provided with but
<b>one trap</b> for all (Fig. 31), there will be a constant
current of air along the pipes, sometimes emerging
from one opening and sometimes from another.
This air will be contaminated by the filth that lines
the pipes, and will often be quite offensive. In such
cases, each waste-pipe should be independently
trapped, or (as in the case of bath-tubs or urinals)
the overflow-pipe should be connected with the
trap of the waste-pipe below the water-seal, as in
Fig. 25.</p>

<p>When a body of water sufficiently large to nearly
fill a pipe is discharged into it, it drags air along
with it, and exhausts the air in all branch-pipes to a
greater or less extent. When this exhaustion amounts
to a diminution of the pressure in the pipe of about
1/350, the water in an ordinary trap (with a one-inch
seal) will be forced out of it by the pressure of the
external atmosphere, or in other words will be sucked
out of the trap into the pipe, leaving no water-seal
in the trap, and, therefore, allowing free exit for
sewer-air. This effect is known as the “siphoning”
of the trap, and is most likely to occur when
the main pipe is not open at its upper extremity (is
not ventilated), and when the branch wastes are of
the same size with the main one. This fault is remedied
by the ventilation of the traps, and of the main<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span>
pipes, as described in the regulations above quoted
(17 and 33).</p>

<p>2. <b>To defects in the pipes.</b> (<i>a.</i>) <b>Drains.</b>—Bad
odors in cellars often come from broken earthenware
or tile drains, cracked by settling, or from
rat-holes in cemented drains. Earthenware or brick
drains inside a house should be replaced by iron
ones.</p>

<p>(<i>b.</i>) <b>Joints.</b>—<b>Cement</b> or <b>putty</b> joints are often
cracked. <b>Water-closets</b> sometimes become loosened
from the floor and leak fluids and gases. The
covers of <b>hand-holes</b> of traps sometimes get loose
and leak gas. Sometimes <b>trap-screws</b>, instead of
being at the bottom of the trap, where they are covered
by water, are at the top; if these are loose,
gases may escape. All such defects should be repaired.</p>

<p>(<i>c.</i>) <b>Pipes.</b>—Both lead and iron pipes are corroded
and in time perforated by sewer-air. Such
corrosion is most likely to occur at points where
gases come in contact with a dry part of the pipe,
viz., at the crowns or domes of traps, and in ventilating-pipes.
For this reason, ventilating-pipes should
never be made of thin iron (galvanized iron), and
should always be protected by a tar-coating. The
crowns of lead traps (especially of water-closets) are
often bitten into by rats in search of water. In all
cases when the crown of a trap is perforated, there
is rarely any leakage of fluid to indicate it, but offensive
gases escape. All corroded traps and pipes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span>
should be replaced by new ones, and not patched up.
Holes in iron pipes may be closed by iron bands
surrounding the pipe, and fastened with red-lead
putty and screw-bolts (Fig. 32). A new joint may
be made by means of a saddle-hub (Fig. 33) carefully
secured in a similar manner. Lead pipes are
sometimes protected against rats by being encircled
by tin, or packed in pounded glass.</p>

  <div class="caption">Fig. 33.—Saddle-hub.</div>
</div>

<p>3. <b>To carelessness.</b> (<i>a.</i>) <b>Evaporation.</b>—If
fixtures are not in constant use, the water soon
evaporates from the traps and gives exit to sewer-air.
This often happens in warm weather, and
when a house is vacant for a time. To prevent
evaporation, a little oil may be poured into the trap,
to protect the surface of the water-seal, or it may be
made the special duty of a servant to keep the traps
full of water when the fixtures are not in use.</p>

<p>(<i>b.</i>) <b>Dirt.</b>—The inside of a pipe often becomes
coated with slime, consisting largely of grease, especially
in kitchens. This filthy lining rapidly decomposes,
and that portion above the trap may give out
bad odors. The pipes may be cleansed with a strong
hot solution of soda.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span></p>


<p><i>Examination of House-Drainage.</i></p>

<p>If the object of an examination is to determine
whether the drainage is planned and constructed in
accordance with the best methods of the day, each
point referred to in the above regulations should be
carefully investigated.</p>

<p>If the object is to determine the source of offensive
odors, or if there has been sickness in the house
of such a character as to indicate possible defects in
the plumbing, the several sources of bad odors just
enumerated should each be carefully inquired into.
A few additional suggestions as to the method of examination
will not be out of place.</p>

<p>It will be found much easier to determine the
direction, number, and situation of the main lines of
pipe, if the examination is begun at the roof and
continued downward. If a beginning is made in the
cellar, confusion results.</p>

<p>“<b>Cushioning</b>” is determined by causing the
discharge of a considerable mass of water (as from a
bath-tub or water-closet) into the main pipe, at some
distance above the suspected fixture. If there is a
regurgitation in the fixture under observation, there
is certainly an obstruction in the pipe at some point
below the fixture. If the obstruction is caused by
something lodged in the pipe, the back-flow in the
fixture will be a steady one, because there will be
some leakage through the obstruction, while if it is
due to compressed air, which is elastic, the regurgi<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span>tation
will be by spurts, and the water in the trap
may even be thrown up to a considerable height.</p>

<p>“<b>Siphoning</b>” is also determined by filling the
pipe with water in the manner just explained. If
the trap of the fixture under observation is emptied
by siphoning, a sucking or gurgling noise will be
heard in it, and a flame held over the outlet of the
fixture will be drawn downward by the inward current
of air.</p>

<p><b>One trap to several pipes</b> (when it is suspected
but not certainly known because the trap is
out of sight) may be detected by the fact that there
will always be a current of air in one direction or
the other through such pipes, and more or less odor
will escape. If the back of the hand is wet, it becomes
very sensitive to such a current, and by holding
alternately the palm and the back of the hand,
or even of the forefinger (wet), over an opening, the
existence and direction of such a current can be
easily determined. If the odors are from such a
source, it can then be made evident by covering all
the outlets but one with wet paper, so as to prevent
the air-currents, when the odors will temporarily disappear.</p>

<p>If a trap is accessible, it is easy to determine
whether its water-seal is preserved or not by tapping
it from top to bottom with some metallic substance,
when the difference in sound will indicate the exact
level of the water inside.</p>

<p>Those parts of the plumbing which are not ac<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span>cessible
to inspection must be examined by introducing
into the pipes some strong-smelling substance,
which will indicate defects by its escape
through them into the house. Oil of peppermint
is often used for this purpose.</p>


<p class="center"><i>The Peppermint-Test.</i></p>

<p>For testing the pipes of an ordinary dwelling,
one ounce of the <b>oil</b> of peppermint is sufficient.
For a large building more may be needed. The
drug costs from twenty-five to seventy-five cents an
ounce, according to its quality and the place where
it is bought.</p>

<p>It is best to introduce the oil into the pipes from
outside the house, if possible, so that the odor which
inevitably attends the process may be dissipated in
the external air. The object being to ascertain the
location of defects in the pipes inside the house, the
examiner must feel certain, if he detects the odor of
peppermint anywhere, that the vapor has come to him
from inside the pipes, and not from the outside. If
the ventilating-pipes are so constructed that the oil
can not be poured in from the roof, then it must be
poured into some basin or water-closet in the upper
portion of the house. The peppermint should first
be mingled with a pailful of hot water to promote
rapid volatilization, and poured slowly down the pipe.
After it is poured down, the openings at the upper
extremities of the pipes should be closed, so that the
pressure of the vapor inside the pipes may not be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span>
relieved in that direction. If the odor of peppermint,
thus introduced with the precautions mentioned below,
is perceived anywhere in the house, it is an indication
that there is an opening in some pipe,
through which sewer-air may escape. This opening
may be a defect, or it may be due to siphoning of
traps, or to faults of original construction. There
will not usually be much difficulty in locating it
with considerable exactness.</p>


<p class="center"><i>Special Precautions.</i></p>

<p>The peppermint should be kept on the roof, or
on a window-sill outside the house, until needed, for
it is so volatile that the vapor escapes through the
cork, and if the odor gets into the house in this way,
it will vitiate the examination.</p>

<p>The person who pours the peppermint should remain
on the roof or in the room where he does it,
with the doors closed, until the examination is complete,
for the odor will cling to his clothing and follow
him wherever he goes for an hour or more.</p>


<p class="center"><i>Additional Remarks.</i></p>

<p>If bad odors have been noticed, and no defect
can be found in the ways above mentioned, they may
be due to decaying animal matter (dead rats, etc.),
or (in the city) to defects in the plumbing of the adjoining
house, offensive gases from which may penetrate
the wall.</p>

<p>The source of bad odors need not necessarily be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span>
in the immediate vicinity of the place where they
are noticed, for the walls of buildings are full of
channels and openings, through which offensive
gases may be carried by currents of air, so as to
emerge at a considerable distance from their origin.
Thus, in winter, they are apt to be most noticeable
near a fire.</p>

<p><b>How to prevent contamination of the air
from the ground.</b></p>

<p>Have the house separated from the soil on which
it is built by a layer of asphalt between two layers
of cement, extending over the whole cellar-floor,
through the foundation-walls and up above the point
where the ground touches the walls outside. Or
have the house built without a cellar, and with perforated
underpinning, so as to allow a free circulation
of air underneath it. The subsoil should also
be drained by tiles laid at least a foot lower than the
cellar-bottom.</p>

<p>The cold-air boxes of furnaces should draw their
supply from the external air. It is advisable to have
a thin layer of cotton held in place by wire gauze to
filter the air as it enters them.</p>

<small>DISINFECTION.</small></h2>
</div>

<p><b>How to prevent contamination of the air
by the respiration, bodily emanations, and
excreta of diseased persons.</b></p>

<p>It is not possible with our present knowledge to
prevent the multiplication of morbid germs in the
human body, when they are once implanted there,
nor to prevent their discharge; but we can destroy
them after their exit from the body, and so protect
other persons who are not yet affected.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span></p>

<p>The following instructions for the management
of contagious diseases were prepared for the National
Board of Health by Professors Chandler,
Henry Draper, Barker, Vander Poel, E.
G. Janeway, and Ira Remsen.</p>


<p class="center"><i>Instructions for Disinfection.</i></p>

<p>Disinfection is the destruction of the poisons of
infectious and contagious diseases.</p>

<p>Deodorizers, or substances which destroy smells,
are not necessarily disinfectants, and disinfectants
do not necessarily have an odor.</p>

<p>Disinfection can not compensate for want of
cleanliness nor of ventilation.</p>


<p class="center">I. <i>Disinfectants to be employed.</i></p>

<p>1. Roll-sulphur (brimstone) for fumigation.</p>

<p>2. Sulphate of iron (copperas) dissolved in water
in the proportion of one and a half pounds to the
gallon; for soil, sewers, etc.</p>

<p>3. Sulphate of zinc and common salt, dissolved
together in water in the proportion of four ounces
sulphate and two ounces salt to the gallon; for
clothing, bed-linen, etc.</p>


<p class="center">II. <i>How to use Disinfectants.</i></p>

<p>1. In the sick-room. The most available agents
are fresh air and cleanliness. The clothing, towels,
bed-linen, etc., should on removal from the patient,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span>
and before they are taken from the room, be placed
in a pail or tub of the zinc solution, boiling-hot if
possible.</p>

<p>All discharges should either be received in vessels
containing copperas solution, or, when this is
impracticable, should be immediately covered with
copperas solution. All vessels used about the patient
should be cleansed with the same solution.</p>

<p>Unnecessary furniture, especially that which is
stuffed, carpets and hangings, should, when possible,
be removed from the room at the outset; otherwise
they should remain for subsequent fumigation and
treatment.</p>

<p>2. Fumigation with sulphur is the only practicable
method for disinfecting the house. For this
purpose, the rooms to be disinfected must be vacated.
Heavy clothing, blankets, bedding, and other
articles which can not be treated with zinc solution,
should be opened and exposed during fumigation, as
directed below. Close the rooms as tightly as possible,
place the sulphur in iron pans supported upon
bricks placed in wash-tubs containing a little water,
set it on fire by hot coals or with the aid of a spoonful
of alcohol, and allow the room to remain closed
for twenty-four hours. For a room about ten feet
square, at least two pounds of sulphur should be
used; for larger rooms, proportionally increased
quantities.</p>

<p>3. Premises. Cellars, yards, stables, gutters,
privies, cesspools, water-closets, drains, sewers, etc.,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span>
should be frequently and liberally treated with copperas
solution. The copperas solution is easily prepared
by hanging a basket containing about sixty
pounds of copperas in a barrel of water.</p>

<p>4. Body and bed clothing, etc. It is <b>best</b> to
<b>burn</b> all articles which have been in contact with
persons sick with contagious or infectious diseases.
Articles too valuable to be destroyed should be
treated as follows:</p>

<p>(<i>a.</i>) Cotton, linen, flannels, blankets, etc., should
be treated with the boiling-hot zinc solution; introduce
piece by piece, secure thorough wetting, and
boil for at least half an hour.</p>

<p>(<i>b.</i>) Heavy woolen clothing, silks, furs, stuffed
bed-covers, beds, and other articles which can not
be treated with the zinc solution, should be hung in
the room during fumigation, their surfaces thoroughly
exposed and pockets turned inside out. Afterward
they should be hung in the open air, beaten
and shaken. Pillows, beds, stuffed mattresses, upholstered
furniture, etc., should be cut open, the
contents spread out and thoroughly fumigated. Carpets
are best fumigated on the floor, but should afterward
be removed to the open air and thoroughly
beaten.</p>

<p>5. Corpses, especially of persons that have died
of any infectious or malignant disease, should be
thoroughly washed with a zinc solution of double
strength; should then be wrapped in a sheet, wet
with the zinc solution, and buried at once.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span></p>

<p>Metallic, metal-lined, or air-tight coffins should
be used when possible; certainly when the body is
to be transported for any considerable distance.</p>


<p class="center"><i>Comments.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Section I.</span> 1. Copperas, also called green vitriol.</p>

<p>2. About four tablespoonfuls of the zinc and two
tablespoonfuls of the salt, making a solution of the
chloride of zinc.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Section II.</span> 1. The windows should be kept
open, if possible, but in such a way as to avoid
draughts on the bed. A fire should be constantly
burning in an open fireplace.</p>

<p>The room should be on the top floor, and all
cracks and openings communicating with other
rooms should be closed tightly. The door which
has to be used should have a wet sheet hanging entirely
over it, the windows and fireplace being alone
relied on for ventilation.</p>

<p>2. The burning of sulphur produces sulphurous
acid, which is an irrespirable gas. The person who
lights the sulphur must, therefore, immediately leave
the room, and after the lapse of the proper time,
must hold his breath as he enters the room to open
the windows and let out the gas. After fumigation,
plastered walls should be whitewashed, the wood-work
well scrubbed with carbolic soap, and painted
portions repainted.</p>

<p>3. Or put copperas in a pail of water, in such
quantity that some may constantly remain undis<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span>solved
at the bottom. This makes a saturated solution.
To every privy or water-closet, allow one pint
of the solution for every four persons when cholera
is about. To keep privies from being offensive, pour
one pint into each seat, night and morning.</p>

<p>4. (<i>a.</i>) Such articles should never be sent to a
public laundry or mingled with the family washing.</p>

<p>(<i>b.</i>) The cutting open of stuffed articles may
seem unnecessary, but it is not. The poison of contagious
diseases clings to such stuffs (called <b>fomites</b>)
with great tenacity for years, and must be destroyed
before they are fit to be used again.</p>

<p>5. It is also well to fill a large wad of cotton
or fine shavings with coal-tar powder or chloride
of lime and place it beneath the hips, to absorb
fluids.</p>

<p>Contagious diseases are often caught at the funerals
of those who have died of them, and the sanitary
code of New York city forbids a public funeral
of any person who has died of small-pox, diphtheria,
scarlet fever, yellow fever, typhus fever, or Asiatic
cholera. It is better to limit the attendance at such
funerals to as few as possible.</p>


<p class="center"><i>Additional Precautions in Special Diseases.</i></p>

<p><b>Small-pox.</b>—Every one in the vicinity should
be vaccinated with fresh virus. Every person should
be vaccinated in infancy, again after puberty, and
again within four days after exposure to small-pox.
Special care should be paid to isolation. Inmates<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span>
of the house should neither make nor receive visits
while the patient is sick.</p>

<p><b>Diphtheria</b> and <b>Consumption</b>.—Special care
should be taken to avoid inhaling the breath of the
patient, as the diseases are communicated through
the secretions of the nose, throat, and lungs. The
matter coughed up should be received on rags and
immediately burned.</p>

<p><b>Scarlet Fever</b> and <b>Measles</b>.—These are communicable
during convalescence, as well as during
the illness. The body of the patient should be
anointed twice a day with sweet-oil, lard, or vaseline,
containing ten grains of carbolic acid or thymol to
the ounce. This should be continued until all bran-like
scaling of the skin is at an end. Before again
associating with unprotected persons, the patient
should have several complete ablutions, including
thorough washing of the hair with soap or borax;
and none of the clothing worn for several days before
the disease declared itself should be again used
until thoroughly disinfected, and ventilated in the
open air several days (New York State Board of
Health circular).</p>

<p><b>Typhoid Fever</b>, <b>Asiatic Cholera</b>, and <b>Dysentery</b>.—Poison
contained in discharges from the
bowels. Particular attention should be paid to the
disinfection of such discharges by the zinc or copperas
solution.</p>

<p><b>Yellow Fever.</b>—Poison possibly contained in
discharges from stomach and bowels, but requiring<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span>
special conditions for development outside the body
before it can affect other persons. Excreta should
be immediately disinfected. Germs may be carried
long distances in <b>fomites</b> (clothing, bedding, and
other porous substances), and disinfection of such
articles must be very thorough.</p>

<p><b>Typhus Fever.</b>—No visiting to be allowed.</p>

<p>When there is small-pox, diphtheria, scarlet fever,
measles, or typhus fever in a house, immediate attendants
on the sick should not leave the house
without a change of outside clothing.</p>


<p class="center"><i>General Precautions for those entering a Sick-Room.</i></p>

<p>Never enter a sick-room with an empty stomach,
or when very tired.</p>

<p>Never eat or drink anything that has been long
exposed to the air of the sick-room.</p>

<p>Breathe through your nose, and keep your mouth
shut except when you are talking.</p>

<small>FOOD.</small></h2>
</div>

<p>How to distinguish a good article of food from
a bad one, when both are in their natural state, is
within the province of the cook-book. In this place
will be pointed out only the adulterations of food,
and those methods of detecting them which can be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span>
used by householders who have no special knowledge
of the instrumental and chemical means which are
generally necessary.</p>

<p>Adulterations are of two kinds: those which injure
the consumer, and those which simply cheat
him. The following details are chiefly taken from
the New York State Board of Health report for
1881-’82, the name of the analyst being in each case
appended.</p>

<p><b>Arrowroot.</b>—Often mixed with cheaper starches.
Twenty-three samples examined: seventeen were
arrowroot, one was arrowroot and tapioca, two arrowroot,
tapioca, and potato, and three tapioca and
potato. Harmless. (E. G. Love, Ph. D.)</p>

<p><b>Bakers’ chemicals.</b>—(Saleratus.) This was
originally bicarbonate of potash, but the name is
now applied to the bicarbonate of soda. Twenty
samples: none adulterated.—(Baking-soda.) Twenty-three
samples: twenty samples unadulterated. One
contained 25 per cent of gypsum; one same quantity
of gypsum and a little starch; one a large amount
of sulphate of soda and 17 per cent of carbonate of
lime.—(Cream of tartar.) This is the bitartrate of
potash. Twenty-seven samples: sixteen adulterated
and in some not a particle of cream of tartar found.
Six adulterated with terra alba (gypsum) and starch,
one with starch alone, two with starch, terra alba,
and acid phosphate of lime. Six had tartaric acid
and no cream of tartar. In eight the amount of
terra alba was found to vary from 3.27 to 93 per cent.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span>
Five samples contained over 70 per cent of this injurious
adulteration. (Love.)</p>

<p><b>Baking-powders.</b>—Contain bicarbonate of
soda and some acid or acid salt, which combine
when water is added and evolve carbonic-acid gas.
There are four classes in use. One contains cream
of tartar, one tartaric acid, one the acid phosphate
of lime, and one potash or ammonia alum. Many
powders contain a salt of ammonia. The pungent
odor of this substance prevents its use in any but
the smallest quantities, and it can not affect the
wholesomeness of the powder. Flour or starch forms
an ingredient of many powders to prevent a premature
combination of its constituents and a consequent
deterioration of the powder. Eighty-four samples:
seventy-three had flour or starch; thirty-five contained
ammonia. Eight adulterated with terra alba,
phosphate of lime, or tartrate of lime. As a rule,
these powders are harmless. (Love.)</p>

<p>(Alum.) There does not seem sufficient evidence
as to the injurious effects of alum upon the human
system to warrant legislation against it. (Love.)</p>

<p><b>Beer.</b>—Most adulterations are harmless. Corn,
rice, wheat, glucose, starch, potatoes, etc., are used
in making beer, and in many countries are allowed
by special laws (as in England and Germany). The
use of substitutes for hops within the last few years
is hardly possible to believe, since hops have been
so cheap, in fact, almost the cheapest bitter, and
are, moreover, as every brewer knows, the best ma<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span>terial
to preserve his beer. (F. E. Engelhardt,
Ph. D.)</p>

<p><b>Brandy.</b>—Cognac brandy is naturally colorless,
but public taste demands a brown color, which is
imparted by a mixture of caramel (burned sugar). A
very large proportion of the brandy in the world is
made of corn-spirit colored with burned sugar and
flavored with oil of cognac (an essential oil derived
from the lees of wine; twenty-five hundred pounds of
lees make one pound of oil.) Here is one recipe:
“To every ten gallons of pure spirits add two quarts
New England rum or one quart Jamaica rum, and
from thirty to forty drops of oil of cognac cut in
one half pint of alcohol; color with burned sugar.”
Twenty-five samples examined: sixteen contained
fusel-oil, six had traces of it, and three none. (Engelhardt).
The only injurious ingredient (besides
alcohol) in the artificial brandies seems to be the
fusel-oil contained in the corn-spirit or whisky used
as a base. Rub suspected brandy on the palm of
the hand until it has evaporated. Fusel-oil may
then still be detected by the smell. Good brandy
will leave no odor.</p>

<p><b>Bread.</b>—Ten samples: no adulteration. (Love.)
In 1873, Elwyn Waller, for the New York City Board
of Health, examined fifty-one samples, of which
forty-one were unadulterated, and ten contained
traces of copper or alum.</p>

<p><b>Butter.</b>—May be mixed with oleomargarine, and
the adulteration is hard to detect. Oleomargarine<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span>
is more crumbly than butter in cold weather. Often
colored with annotto, and, as this sometimes contains
a little sulphate of copper, a trace of copper may
occasionally be found in butter. As a rule, adulterations
of butter are harmless.</p>

<p><b>Candy.</b>—“Taffy” and gum-drops are almost all
glucose. Coloring-matters usually harmless, but of
ten samples of yellow candy, seven contained chromate
of lead. (W. H. Pitt, M. D.) Candy often
contains terra alba, flour, and gum-arabic. The only
injurious ingredients usually found are terra alba
(recognized by its grittiness and insolubility) and
the chromate of lead. On account of the latter it is
best to avoid yellow, green, and orange candies.</p>

<p><b>Canned fruits</b> and <b>vegetables</b>.—Eighteen
samples, including peaches, plums, grapes, strawberries,
cherries, blackberries, olives, mushrooms, corn,
beans, succotash, tomatoes, pumpkin, and peas. No
adulteration found. Attention was given to the
possibility of the chemical reaction of the fruit acids
upon the inner surface of the cans, whereby salts of
tin and lead might be produced, rendering the contents
in some degree poisonous. There was no evidence
of their presence. Some of the articles were
canned over a year before. (S. A. Lattimore, Ph. D.)
<b>Per contra</b>, other analysts have found from .1 to
2.3 grains of tin to the can. There is no evidence,
however, that this amount of tin in solution is injurious,
and the recent investigations of Hall seem
to show that the fruit acids do not act appreciably<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span>
on the tin or the lead of the solder, so long as the
air is excluded. Cans once opened should therefore
be emptied, and not left partly full.</p>

<p><b>Canned meats.</b>—No adulterations and no tin
or lead found. The heads of all cans should be
slightly concave. This shows that the contents were
hot when the can was sealed. If the heads are convex,
the contents are decomposing.</p>

<p><b>Cereals.</b>—Ninety-four samples, including wheat
and Graham flour, farina, oatmeal, rye, barley, corn-meal,
rice, buckwheat, sago, and tapioca. Two
adulterated. Adulterations consisted in mixture of
other cereals, and were harmless. (Love.)</p>

<p><b>Cheese.</b>—Skim-milk cheese often contains lard,
put in to replace the butter which has been removed.
This adulteration improves the quality of the cheese
and often can not be detected by experts. One
sample of cheese, which had caused sickness in those
who ate it, was examined, and, although it also made
the analyst ill, no known poisonous substance could
be detected in it. (G. C. Caldwell, Ph. D.) All yellow
cheese is colored with annotto, which can therefore
hardly be considered an adulteration. The rind
is sometimes washed with a mercurial or arsenical solution,
to protect it from insects, and should therefore
never be eaten.</p>

<p><b>Cocoa</b> and <b>chocolate</b>.—Six samples. None
adulterated. (Lattimore.)</p>

<p><b>Coffee.</b>—Thirty-five samples of unroasted, three
of roasted unground, twenty-one of ground, three of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span>
coffee extract. Of the thirty-five unroasted, in five
a few grains were found which had been slightly
colored or faced, apparently with Prussian blue; the
three roasted unground were pure; of the twenty-one
ground, nineteen contained chiccory, beans, wheat,
rye, etc. One sample consisted entirely of roasted
hominy. Three samples of coffee extract consisted
chiefly of caramel and licorice, and contained no
coffee. (Lattimore.) Pure coffee swims in water, and
colors it slowly. Chiccory sinks and colors water
rapidly. Peas sink and color water slowly. Rye
sinks more rapidly than coffee, and colors water
more quickly. Ground coffee is hard and crumbles
between the teeth; chiccory is soft and does not
crumble.</p>

<p><b>Gin.</b>—No injurious adulterations detected.
Twenty-five samples. (Engelhardt.)</p>

<p><b>Honey.</b>—Three samples: two pure. One, labeled
“white-clover honey,” contained 50 per cent
of artificial glucose. The presence of added glucose
is indicated by the turbidity produced by oxalic acid
in a solution of the honey in distilled water. This
turbidity is due to the presence of gypsum in artificial
glucose—a substance which is not contained in
pure honey. (Pitt.)</p>

<p><b>Horse-radish.</b>—Often harmlessly adulterated
with grated turnip.</p>

<p><b>Isinglass.</b>—Two samples. Both were common
gelatine. (Chester.)</p>

<p><b>Jellies.</b>—Fruit-jellies are often simple apple-jel<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span>ly,
flavored with artificial essences and colored with
aniline. Safest not to use them unless their source
is known to be trustworthy.</p>

<p><b>Lard.</b>—Twenty-eight samples. Fifteen pure;
the rest contained water. Good lard should melt to
a clear fat without sputtering.</p>

<p><b>Meat.</b>—Sound fresh meat is pale red when first
cut, the surface after exposure turning to a deep red.
The meat of animals that have died a natural death
is of a deep purple color, not having been bled. The
greatest danger in meat, however, is that due to the
presence of trichinæ, which are killed by a temperature
of 160° Fahr. All forms of pork should therefore
be cooked thoroughly before eating. (Chester.)
Poisoning (vomiting, cramps, and diarrhœa)
produced by meat is generally caused by some kind
of preserved meat (sausages, pickled meats, etc.),
and is probably due to the presence of fungi.</p>

<p><b>Milk.</b>—Frauds consist generally in adding water
or removing fat (skimming). As the milk of healthy
cows varies in composition within certain limits, it is
necessary to have a standard of purity, which has
been fixed upon in New York as follows: Nearly
1,000 cows have been examined, with reference to
the specific gravity of their milk, in New York, New
Jersey, and Connecticut. The maximum specific
gravity was 1.039 in milk of an Alderney cow. The
minimum for normal milk from a healthy cow was
1.029. The specific gravity is determined by an instrument
called a lactometer, on which 0 stands for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span>
1,000, the specific gravity of water, and 100 for 1,029,
that of the poorest milk from a healthy cow. The
composition of such milk, adopted by the English
Society of Public Analysts and the New York City
Board of Health, as a result of fifty analyses, is as
follows:</p>


<table class="standard" summary="">
<tr>
<td class="tdl">Fat</td>
<td class="tdr">2.5</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="tdl">Solids, not fat (sugar, salt, etc.)</td>
<td class="tdr">9.0</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="tdl">Water</td>
<td class="tdr">88.5</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="tdl"></td>
<td class="tdr_bt">100.0</td>
</tr>
</table>


<p><b>Method of using the Lactometer.</b>—Put the
milk in a vessel so deep that the lactometer, when
introduced and allowed to float, shall not touch the
bottom. Notice the reading of the scale at the surface
of the milk. If it is less than 100, it gives the
percentage of milk in the sample. For example, if
the reading be 80, the sample contains 80 per cent
of milk and 20 per cent of water.</p>

<p><b>Sources of Error.</b>—Milk very rich in cream
may possibly, though not probably, register less than
100, but its very appearance will show that it has not
been thinned by water or by skimming.</p>

<p>Skimmed milk, especially if a little salt has been
added, may register high above 100, but its thinness
and blueness will show that it has been doctored.</p>

<p>Condensed milk was carefully analyzed, and
found to be unobjectionable. (C. E. Munsell, Ph. D.)</p>

<p><b>Olive-Oil.</b>—Often adulterated with poppy, cotton-seed,
ground or peanut, sesame, rape-seed, colza<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span>
or beechnut oil, all harmless. Sixteen samples; nine
adulterated. (Caldwell.)</p>

<p><b>Pickles.</b>—Nine samples. None contained copper
or any other metal. The only sample that possessed
a suspiciously green appearance was found to
contain alum. (Lattimore.)</p>

<p><b>Rum.</b>—Twenty-five samples. No objectionable
additions found. (Engelhardt.)</p>

<p><b>Sirups.</b>—Three samples of maple-sirup. Two
were pure, and one, manufactured in Chicago and
sold in cans, contained 35 per cent of artificial glucose.
In 1870 Dr. Chandler found .02 per cent of
tin in each of two samples of sugar-house sirups.
This represents .8 grain of tin to the gallon. A
common adulterant of sirups is glucose, which diminishes
their sweetening power, but is not considered
injurious.</p>

<p><b>Spices.</b>—One hundred and eighty samples, comprising
mustard, ginger, allspice, cinnamon, cassia,
cloves, white, black, and red pepper, mace, and nutmeg.
One hundred and twelve were adulterated
from 40 to 81.8 per cent. All the adulterations
were harmless (wheat and buckwheat bran, hulls
of different seeds, middlings of corn-meal, stale
ship’s bread, peas, beans, etc.). No poisonous substance
was found. (Lattimore.)</p>

<p><b>Sugar.</b>—One hundred and sixteen samples, principally
collected in New York city. Care was taken
to secure the samples from different sections of the
city and from all classes of stores. Of these, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span>
thirty-four were microscopically clean, fifty-four slightly
contaminated with dust, twenty-two contained considerable
dirt, and six were very dirty. But in no
case was there an intentional addition of insoluble
mineral matters. Of forty-nine white sugars, all were
pure; of sixty-seven brown sugars, four were adulterated
with glucose. (A. L. Colby, Ph. B.)</p>

<p>There have been many exaggerated statements
put forth regarding the adulteration of sugar. In
1870 Dr. Chandler reported to the New York City
Board of Health that sixty samples of sugar bought
at small groceries were found pure and unadulterated
without exception. In 1872, Elwyn Waller, for
the same board, examined one hundred and nine
samples of powdered sugar, but found no adulteration.</p>

<p>Powdered sugar is quite generally believed to be
adulterated with gypsum or flour. As both of these
adulterants are insoluble in water, it is easy for any
one to convince himself of the purity of sugar by dissolving
it in water.</p>

<p><b>Teas.</b>—Forty-three samples of green tea, and
eighteen of black. Many were cheap and of very
inferior quality, some mere tea rubbish, yet no leaf,
or fragment of a leaf, which was examined, could be
considered anything but tea. No adulterations were
found, and even the admixture of exhausted leaves
could not be positively asserted. (Lattimore.) Suspected
leaves should be wet and spread out, and
then compared with leaves known to be genuine. It<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span>
is said that exhausted leaves of green tea are often
colored or “faced” with plumbago, Prussian blue,
soapstone, etc., so artfully that only an expert can
detect the fraud. Black tea is generally pure.</p>

<p><b>Vinegar.</b>—Four samples, all poor, but not adulterated,
unless with water. (Lattimore.)</p>

<p><b>Whisky.</b>—Twenty-five samples. Fusel-oil decided
in twenty, and traces in the rest. No injurious
adulteration found. “It is evident that the addition
of water and coloring-matter is practiced more
than any other adulteration.” (Engelhardt.)</p>

<p><b>Wine.</b>—“A good wine should be transparent,
and should have a bouquet. When pouring it into a
glass, it should sparkle. A sour taste is always a sign
of poor wine. Dizziness and headache are not produced
by drinking pure wine. Cloudy, discolored,
highly colored wines are suspicious.” There are
various substances used in the manufacture of wine
which should be classed as adulterations, e.g., calcined
plaster is added to the grape-juice during fermentation
(so-called plastering); in this way is formed
an insoluble tartrate of lime, and a soluble sulphate
of potash, the latter having a bitter taste and acting
as a purgative even in small doses. The French
Government forbids the sale of wine containing over
0.2 per cent of sulphate of potash. This process
also leads to the formation of acid sulphates and free
sulphuric acid in wines. Plastering of wines is practiced
in Spain, Portugal, and the south of France.</p>

<p>Wines are often fortified by the addition of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span>
brandy, cologne spirit, or French spirit, to arrest fermentation.
Ports and sherries are almost invariably
so.</p>

<p>Red wines are often colored with logwood, Brazil-wood,
fuchsine, cochineal, black hollyhock and
red poppy flowers, alkana-root, red beets, cherries,
whortleberries, elderberries, pokeberries, etc. It is
very difficult to detect these, and fuchsin is the only
one that is poisonous. Carpené gives the following
very simple method to decide whether a red wine is
naturally or artificially colored: Take a piece of
good, white burned lime, break it into two pieces,
smooth the surfaces by a knife or file, and place a
few drops in succession on the same spot of the
smooth surface, and observe after a few minutes the
color produced. Natural red wines give a yellowish-brown
spot; colored with fuchsine, or Brazil-wood,
a rose-colored spot; colored with logwood, a dark-violet
spot; colored with cochineal, a reddish-violet
spot; colored with black hollyhock, a yellowish-brown
spot; colored with pokeberries, a yellowish
somewhat red spot. (Engelhardt.)</p>

<p>Another test is to concentrate the wine, and dip
in a piece of pure white woolen-yarn. The natural
red coloring-matter of wine does not dye without a
mordant, while fuchsine and cochineal dye it red or
pink.</p>

<small>WATER.</small></h2>
</div>

<p>In cities and towns which have a common water-supply,
the water sometimes contains impurities dissolved
from the pipes through which it runs, or dirt
and vegetable <i>débris</i> stirred up from the bottom of
the sources of supply, or brought down into them by
heavy storms or melting snows.</p>

<p>Service-pipes are usually made of lead, and, after
moderate use, become coated on their internal surface
with insoluble compounds (sulphate of lead),
which prevent contamination of the water by them.
When the water is not very hard, however, a slight
amount of lead may be dissolved by it. It is said
that Cochituate water (Boston) always contains traces
of lead, but that no well-authenticated case of poisoning
from this source has ever been reported.
Croton water (New York), which has stood overnight
in the pipes, is said to contain one tenth of a
grain of lead per gallon—sufficient to produce poisoning
in some instances. One case of this sort has
been known. If drinking-water is drawn from tanks,
they should never be lined with lead, but should be
made of iron, or of wood lined with tinned and planished
copper. (See “Plumbing Regulations,” 44.)</p>

<p>Water passing through galvanized-iron pipes always
contains zinc salts—not, however, in injurious
amount. Such pipes soon rust.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span></p>

<p>Dirt and other suspended matters should be removed
by means of a <b>filter</b>. A good household
filter must be made of a material which can not
communicate any injurious or offensive quality to
the water that passes through it; it must remove all
suspended particles, so as to render the water bright
and clear; it must be easy to clean, or so arranged
that the filtering material can be readily renewed.
The action of a filter is either mechanical or chemical;
in the latter case, the organic matters contained
in the water are oxidized in the filter. There are
innumerable patent filters in the market, to be attached
to the faucet, but these can only act as strainers.
There is no material known which can be introduced
into the small space of a tap-filter and accomplish
any real <b>purification</b> of the water which
passes through at the ordinary rate of flow. (Nichols.)
The only points to be looked to, therefore, in
purchasing a tap-filter, are its efficiency as a strainer,
and the facility of cleansing or renewing the filtering
material. Where the pressure is not too great, a
closely woven cotton-flannel bag, fastened to the tap,
makes as good a filter as any. For large filters (in
cisterns, etc.), those which contain animal charcoal
are the most efficient.</p>

<p>In places where the drinking-water is drawn from
wells, it is sometimes polluted by leakage from cesspools,
privy-vaults, stables, and refuse matters lying
on the surface of the ground in their vicinity. It
has been demonstrated beyond a doubt that epi<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span>demics
of typhoid fever have often originated and
spread in this way. Even when no specific disease
is caused, water polluted from such sources often
causes diarrhœal disorders and various forms of indigestion
in those who drink it.</p>

<p>The determination of such pollution is a matter
of great delicacy and difficulty, and can only be
trusted to an expert. Waters polluted by organic
matters often contain an excess of gaseous constituents,
and are clear, sparkling, and palatable, presenting
to the uninstructed eye no indication of impurity.
There are certain tests, however, which can be used
by any person of intelligence, when, if positive results
are obtained, an expert should be called in to
determine the source and character of the contamination.</p>

<p>The pollution of water by decomposing animal
matters is always to be suspected, if there are evidences
of the presence of chlorine or nitrogen in the
water, as these are invariable constituents of animal
excreta. These substances are found in combination—the
former in chloride of sodium, and the latter
in the so-called nitrites and nitrates.<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> Their
presence is determined as follows:</p>

<div class="footnotes">
<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_2" href="#FNanchor_2" class="label">[2]</a> The albuminoid ammonia test is too technical for insertion
here.</p>

</div></div>

<p><b>Chlorine.</b>—<i>Tests</i>: Nitrate of silver (twenty-five
cents a drachm), twenty-four grains to one ounce of
distilled water, and dilute nitric acid (ten cents an
ounce). Pour a few drops of each into the suspected<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span>
water. If chlorine is present, there will be a cloudy-white
precipitate of chloride of silver, which will
gradually turn darker. One grain of chlorine to a
gallon of water gives a haze; four grains a marked
turbidity, and ten grains a considerable precipitate.
In case chlorine is found, and any particular source
is suspected, a pailful of salt (chloride of sodium)
and water may be thrown into the place from which
the leakage is supposed to come, and the water again
examined, after a few hours, to see whether the
amount of chlorine has increased.</p>

<p><b>Nitrates.</b>—<i>Tests</i>: Pure sulphuric acid and a
saturated solution of sulphate of iron (copperas).
Add an equal bulk of the acid to any quantity of
the water in a test-tube. The mixture will become
very hot. Wait until it is cool, and then pour in the
iron solution gently, so that it will float above the
mixed acid and water. If nitrates are present, there
will be an olive-colored layer where the fluids meet.</p>

<p><b>Nitrites.</b>—<i>Test-mixture</i>: Iodide of potassium
(fifty cents per ounce), one part; starch, twenty
parts; water, five hundred parts. Make the starch-solution
first, and filter when cold; then add the
iodide of potash. Add to the suspected water this
mixture, and then a little dilute sulphuric acid. If
nitrites are present, there will be an immediate blue
color.</p>

<p><b>Organic Matters in general.</b>—<i>Test</i>: Eight
grains of chemically pure permanganate of potash
in one ounce of distilled water. In half a pint of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span>
the suspected water in a tumbler, put one drop of
the solution. If the red color disappears in one half
hour, add more. For every drop that loses color in
the half-pint there will be found one and a half to
two grains of putrid organic matter in a gallon of the
water. If the action is rapid, the matter is probably
animal; if slow, vegetable.</p>

<p>To <b>purify</b> such water, if it must be used, drop in
the solution until a slight red tinge remains. The
organic matter is then all oxidized and rendered
harmless. It is better, however to boil such water
before using it for drinking.</p>


<p class="center"><i>Precautions with regard to Drinking-Water.</i></p>

<p>Do not drink water that has been standing long
in lead pipes, or lead cisterns or tanks.</p>

<p>Filter it before drinking.</p>

<p>See that the current of ground-water in the well
from which you get your drinking-water is from the
well toward any possible source of contamination
(privy-vault, cesspool, etc.), and not <i>vice versa</i>.</p>

<p>If the use of a suspected water is unavoidable,
boil it first. It can be rendered palatable by an infusion
of tea or coffee.</p>

<p>ALPHABETICAL LIST OF THE COMMON DISINFECTANTS,
WITH A BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF EACH,
AND THE AVERAGE PRICE AT RETAIL.</p>
</div>


<p><b>Carbolic Acid.</b>—A product of the distillation of
coal-tar. When pure and free from water, a transparent
crystalline solid. Dissolves in twenty parts of
cold water. Coagulates albuminous matters. A one-per-cent
solution of it in water arrests putrefaction.
For disinfection use at least a one-per-cent solution.
The chief objection to its use is its odor. This may
be modified to some extent by mixing the pure acid
with camphor, forming a liquid, which may then be
diluted. This acid is often used in combination
with other disinfectants. A preparation much used
by the New York City Board of Health for the disinfection
of clothing contains eight ounces of sulphate
of zinc and three ounces of carbolic acid to
three gallons of water. Another for privies, water-closets,
etc., is composed of ten pounds of copperas,
one pint of carbolic acid, and five gallons of water.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span>
The strong acid injures iron pipe. Do not use in
combination with the permanganate of potash or the
chloride of zinc. “<b>Dead Oil</b>” (heavy oil of coal-tar)
contains from 5 to 15 per cent of carbolic acid
mingled with impurities. It is used for the disinfection
of drains, streets, stables, etc. <b>Thymol</b> also
occurs in coal-tar, but is usually obtained from oil of
thyme. Its action is similar to that of carbolic acid.
<b>Carbolic Powders</b> are made by mixing five parts
of the pure acid, or ten parts of the crude, with one
hundred parts of sawdust, clay, or lime. Squibb’s
Carbolic Acid (No. 1), containing 77.90 per cent of
pure acid, costs $1 a pint; (No. 2), with 37.46 per
cent of pure acid, 75 cents a pint. Different samples
examined (Waller), containing from .20 to .78
per cent, cost from 50 cents to $1 a pint. Crude
acid, containing 50 per cent of acid, with many tarry
impurities, costs less than $1 a gallon. Thymol, $1
per ounce.</p>

<p><b>Charcoal.</b>—Absorbs putrid gases. See <b>Lime</b>.</p>

<p><b>Chloride of Lime.</b> See <b>Chlorine</b>.</p>

<p><b>Chloride of Zinc.</b> See <b>Zinc</b>.</p>

<p><b>Chlorine.</b>—A pale, yellowish-green gas, of a suffocating
quality, possessing great bleaching and disinfecting
powers. When dry, it does not bleach.
When moist, it combines with the hydrogen of water
or of organic substances, and sets free the oxygen,
which constitutes its disinfecting power. It decomposes
sulphureted hydrogen, ammonia, and in general
compounds arising from the putrid fermentation of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span>
organic matter. It is obtained as follows: Pour one
pound of sulphuric acid, previously diluted with four
times its volume of water, on three pounds of chloride
of lime. Mix in a large earthen dish to allow
for frothing up. Or mix two parts, by weight, of the
black oxide (dioxide) of manganese with three parts,
by weight, of strong hydrochloric acid. The gas is
evolved very rapidly, so that it is difficult to make
the mixture complete before the fumes drive away
the person manipulating it. The colors of hangings,
etc., are apt to be bleached out by it, and metals are
corroded. (See also <b>Sulphurous Acid</b>.) <b>Chloride
of Lime.</b>—Made by saturating slaked lime with
chlorine-gas. It contains on an average about 30
per cent of available chlorine, to be set free by an
acid. Very useful for disinfection of cellars, damp
yards, and areas. One half pound in a gallon of
water may be used for washing floors of sick-rooms,
etc. Heat destroys its disinfecting properties.
<b>Chloride of Aluminum.</b>—Action similar to but
weaker than the iron and zinc salts, q. v. Sulphuric
acid, black oxide of manganese, and hydrochloric
acid, each 5 cents an ounce. Chloride of lime, 15
cents a pound.</p>

<p><b>Copperas.</b> (Green vitriol, sulphate of iron.)—Comes
in pale-green crystals. It is an efficient
disinfectant for privies, water-closets, stables, etc.
Stains white goods. Acts by destroying sulphureted
hydrogen and ammonia. Also oxidizes organic
compounds and coagulates albuminous matters. A<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span>
good mixture is four pounds of copperas and three
ounces of carbolic acid to a gallon of water. Ten
cents a pound. One hundred pounds for $3 or
less.</p>

<p><b>Corrosive Sublimate.</b> (Mercuric chloride.)—The
most powerful disinfectant known. Coagulates
albuminous substances. A solution of one part in
2,000 of water kills microscopic organisms. Two
drachms of this substance in a gallon of water (1 to
500) makes a solution sure to destroy any disease-germ.
It is a deadly poison, and can only be purchased
under legal restrictions. Fifteen cents an
ounce.</p>

<p><b>Dead Oil.</b> See <b>Carbolic Acid</b>.</p>

<p><b>Green Vitriol.</b> See <b>Copperas</b>.</p>

<p><b>Gypsum.</b> See <b>Lime</b>.</p>

<p><b>Heat.</b>—Boiling is a good disinfectant. Boil for
at least an hour. If dry air is used, the temperature
must be from 250° to 300° for five or six hours.
Cotton and silk will stand a temperature of 295° for
three hours without harm. Woolen suffers more.</p>

<p><b>Iron, Sulphate of.</b> See <b>Copperas</b>.</p>

<p><b>Lime.</b>—Twenty parts of quicklime, mixed with
two parts of dry, fresh charcoal, form the <b>calx-powder</b>,
as sold in the shops. It is useful to absorb
putrid gases, when sprinkled in cellars, etc. <b>Sulphate
of lime</b>, or <b>gypsum</b> (plaster of Paris), mingled
with coal-tar or impure carbolic acid, is an effective
deodorant for stables and manure-heaps. It
absorbs and retains ammonia, and therefore pre<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span>serves
to the manure its most valuable constituent.
<b>Chloride of lime.</b> See <b>Chlorine</b>. Quicklime, 5
cents a pound. Gypsum, 10 cents a pound.</p>

<p><b>Nitrate of Lead.</b>—Theoretically a good disinfectant,
but practically of little use. Five cents an
ounce.</p>

<p><b>Nitrous Acid.</b>—Evolved in the form of brownish-red
fumes, when nitric acid is poured on copper
turnings. Very dangerous to inhale, and little used
as a disinfectant.</p>

<p><b>Ozone.</b>—Is a form of oxygen, supposed to be
three volumes condensed into two. Is a powerful
oxidizer. Corrodes cork, paper, and other organic
substances. Oxidizes very rapidly compounds of
ammonia, phosphorus, and sulphur, which are offensive,
instantly removing the odor. Simple vegetables,
like mould, are completely destroyed by it.
Obtained by gradually mixing three parts of sulphuric
acid with two parts of permanganate of potash.
This mixture will continue to give off ozone for several
months. Or, put a piece of phosphorus on a
plate, and pour in water sufficient to cover two
thirds of it. These methods are used in the patented
ozone generators. Phosphorus, 40 cents an ounce;
sulphuric acid, 5 cents an ounce.</p>

<p><b>Permanganate of Potash.</b>—Dark purple
crystals, almost black. A solution is of a beautiful
purple color, but stains brown almost everything it
touches. Can not be used with carbolic acid or the
coal-tar disinfectants. Is a powerful oxidizer, and is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span>
used to disinfect excreta, and to purify drinking-water.
Fifty cents an ounce.</p>

<p><b>Sulphate of Iron.</b> See <b>Copperas</b>.</p>

<p><b>Sulphate of Lime.</b> See <b>Lime</b>.</p>

<p><b>Sulphate of Zinc.</b> See <b>Zinc</b>.</p>

<p><b>Sulphurous Acid.</b> An irrespirable gas, produced
by burning sulphur. Powerful disinfectant.
Coagulates albuminous matters and probably destroys
germs. Destroys sulphureted hydrogen and
ammonia. Dry articles are not hurt by it, but wet
clothes are bleached. Can not be used with chlorine,
as they neutralize each other. Chlorine is as effective,
but is so destructive that it can only be used in
empty rooms. It requires about a tablespoonful of
alcohol to light a pound of sulphur. Sulphur (roll-brimstone),
10 cents a pound.</p>

<p><b>Thymol.</b> See <b>Carbolic Acid</b>.</p>

<p><b>Zinc Salts.</b>—The sulphate and the chloride of
zinc are excellent disinfectants. They are colorless,
and can therefore be used on clothing. They form,
with albuminous matters, extremely insoluble compounds,
and also absorb gases from putrefying material.
They are the best disinfectants of their class.
The sulphate is cheaper, but the chloride more efficient.
Sulphate of zinc, 10 cents an ounce; chloride
of zinc, 20 cents an ounce.</p>

<p>It is better and cheaper to buy and mix one’s
own disinfectants. The many proprietary articles
are no more efficient, and are very expensive. The
composition of some of those most in use is here<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span>

Health Department.)</p>

<p class="center"><i>CONDUCTED BY E. L. AND W. J. YOUMANS.</i></p>


<p><span class="smcap">The Popular Science Monthly</span> was established a dozen years
ago to bring before the general public the results of scientific thought
on many large and important questions which could find no expression
in the current periodicals. Scientific inquiry was penetrating
many new fields, extending important knowledge, and profoundly
affecting opinion upon numberless questions of speculative and practical
interest. It was the policy of this magazine at the outset, and
has been constantly adhered to since, to obtain the ablest statements
from the most distinguished scientific men of all countries in their
bearing upon the higher problems of investigation. Leaving the dry
and technical details of science, which are of chief concern to specialists,
to the journals devoted to them, <span class="smcap">The Popular Science
Monthly</span> has dealt with those more general and practical subjects
which are of the greatest interest and importance to the people at
large.</p>

<p>Science is the great agency of improvement in this age, private and
public, individual, social, professional, and industrial. In its irresistible
progress it touches everywhere, and affects everybody. It gives
law to the material interests of the community, and modifies its ideas,
opinions, and beliefs, so that all have an interest in being informed of
its advancement. Those, therefore, who desire to know what is
going on in the world of thought in these stirring times, when new
knowledge is rapidly extending, and old errors are giving way, will
find that they can keep informed only by subscribing for <span class="smcap">The Popular
Science Monthly</span>.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Terms</span>: $5.00 per annum, or 50 cents a number; cloth covers for
the volumes, 50 cents each.</p>

<p>The volumes begin with May and November of each year, and
subscriptions may begin at any time.</p>

<p>A club of five will be supplied for $20.00 per annum.</p>

and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or

</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
